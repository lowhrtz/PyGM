The assassin need not roll to hit for an assassination attempt, which is a special attack resulting in a chance to kill the victim instantly and ensure damage even if the victim is not successfully killed. The percentage chance to kill a victim is 50%, with a bonus of 5% per level of the assassin and a penalty of 5% for every two levels of the target (rounding down; in the case of monsters, substitute “hit dice” for “level”). These numbers are approximate, for the GM should modify the assassin’s chances slightly upward or downward according to the circumstances—guarded or wary targets are less likely to be killed, and unwary victims are more likely to die. If the assassination attempt does not succeed, the attack still inflicts normal damage, together with any applicable bonuses. The assassin does not gain backstab multiple damage on a failed assassination attempt, even if the assassination attempt was made from behind.'],

Also, an assassin attacks from behind with a bonus to hit of +4 rather than the ordinary +2.'],

Within reasonable limits, an assassin can make him- or herself appear slightly shorter or considerably taller, fatter or thinner, or of the opposite gender. An assassin can even disguise him- or herself as a member of another race (again, within reason). Any person observing the disguised assassin has a base 2% chance to see through the disguise, with one chance per day to do so. The base chance of seeing through a disguise increases another 2% if the assassin is posing as another class, race or gender (max 8% chance). The GM may assign additional penalties and bonuses to this check if the observer is unusually wise or intelligent (or particularly stupid), and common sense, of course, applies at all times.'],

The staff may be used to effect the following spell-like abilities: <i>detect magic</i>, <i>enlarge</i>, <i>hold portal</i>, <i>light</i>, and <i>protection from good (evil)</i>. These abilities do not require the expenditure of charges.<br /><br />In addition, the staff has the following abilities that cost 1 charge per use: <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>fireball</i>, <i>ice storm</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, <i>knock</i>, <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>passwall</i>, <i>pyrotechnics</i>, <i>wall of fire</i>, and <i>web</i>. The following powerful abilities cost 2 charges per use: <i>conjure elemental</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, <i>telekinesis</i>, and <i>whirlwind</i> (as a genie).<br /><br />The wielder of the staff receives a bonus of +2 for saving throws vs magic. This staff may be recharged, but only by absorbing magical energies that are cast at the wielder. When a spell is cast at the wielder, he may choose to absorb these energies, at a rate of 1 charge per spell level of the spell directed at him. Note that taking this manoeuvre is the sole action of the staff for that round, and it may not be used for other effects in the same round it absorbs energy. Each staff has a maximum number of possible charges, and it will only safely absorb charges to this limit. The wielder will not know the limit, or how many charges have been used, unless some magical means is employed to discover this. The staff does not reveal this information. Should the staff collect energy in excess of its limit, it detonates in the same manner as in a retributive strike, as described below.<br /><br />A <i>staff of wizardry</i> can be used for a <i>retributive strike</i>, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. The breaking of the staff must be intentional and declared by the wielder. All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30 ft radius. All within 10 ft of the broken staff take points of damage equal to 8 × the number of charges in the staff, those 10 ft to 20 ft away take 6 × the number of charges in damage, and those 20 ft to 30 ft distant take 4 × the number of charges in damage. All those affected can make saving throws vs magic to reduce the damage by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of travelling to another plane of existence, but if he or she does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him or her. Only the <i>staff of wizardry</i> and the <i>staff of power</i> may be used for a <i>retributive strike</i>.<br /><br />After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +2 quarterstaff. Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a <i>retributive strike</i>.'],

Casting a spell from the ring requires 5 segments. Roll d%, a roll of 01-70 means the ring stores magic user spells and 71-00 indicates clerical spells. 10% of magic user <i>rings of spell storing</i> will contain illusionist spells instead, and 25% of clerical <i>rings of spell storing</i> will contain druid spells instead. Roll 2d4 to determine number of spells the ring can contain. To randomly determine the spell levels of each spell, roll 1d6 (on a result of 6 reroll for level with 1d4) for cleric, druid or illusionist spells, and 1d8 (on a result of 8 reroll for level with 1d6) for magic user spells. Once type, number, and level of spells is determined, the GM must decide which spells the ring contains. The spells can either be hand-picked or the GM may use the OSRIC magic tables and dice for spells randomly. Once the class of spells, their number and level, and the exact spells to be stored are determined, that capability can never be changed. Charging the ring requires a spell caster to cast the specific spell to be stored with the ring as the target of the spell.<br /><br /><i><b>Example of Ring of Spell Storing Creation:</b></i> Jerry the GM decides to place a <i>ring of spell storing</i> in a red dragon’s treasure hoard. He rolls a 57 on d%, indicating the ring contains magic user spells. A second d% roll yields a 05 and this means the ring really contains spells of the illusionist class. Jerry now rolls 2d4 and gets 1 on both dice, meaning the ring will contain 2 spells total. Jerry now rolls 1d6 twice, one for each spell to determine the level of that spell. The first result is a 2, the second is a 6. The 6 needs to be rerolled on a 1d4 and rolling that die generates a result of 4. So, the GM now knows the ring will hold 2 illusionist spells, one of level 2 and one of level 4. Jerry decides to let fate take a hand in the selection of the exact spells the ring stores and takes a look at the illusionist spell tables in the OSRIC manual. There are 12 level 2 illusionist spells, and 8 level 4 spells, so Jerry grabs a d12 and a d8 and rolls them both. The d12 rolls a 4 so Jerry notes the result of <i>detect magic</i>. The d8 rolls an 8 and Jerry notes the result of <i>shadow monsters</i>. Now that the exact properties of the <i>ring of spell storing</i> have been determined, they can never be changed; the ring will ever after only hold the two illusionist spells noted. If the finder of the ring uses it to cast a <i>detect magic</i> spell, then an illusionist must cast a <i>detect magic</i> upon the ring to recharge that spell slot.'],

There are three exceptions to the spell turning ability the ring bestows:<ul><li>Area effect spells which are not directly targeted upon the ring bearer cannot be turned.</li><li>Touch-based spells cannot be turned.</li><li>Spell effects delivered by devices are not turned. Examples include: rods, staves, wands, rings. Note: spell scrolls are not considered devices.</li></ul><br />When a spell is cast at the wearer of the <i>ring of spell turning</i>, he or she rolls a d10 and multiplies the result by 10. When damage from the spell attack is determined, the number generated by this roll indicates what percentage of the damage is reflected back upon the attacker. Thus if “6” appears on the d10, 60% of the damage rolled would be deducted from the attacking spell-caster’s hit points and 40% from the target. Further, for each 10% of difference between the damage percentage rolled and 100%, the ring-bearer gains +1 to his or her saving throw. Going back to the example above, the spell’s target would get a +6 to his or her saving throw and the spell caster would gain a +4.<br /><br />The <i>ring of spell turning</i> also grants a saving throw against spells which normally do not allow one. In such a case, the save will be half of the percentage die roll for spell reflection. Returning once again to the example above, the ring wearer rolling a 60% chance of reflecting an attacking spell would gain a 30% saving throw, reducing or negating effects as appropriate to the spell.<br /><br />Spells that only affect a certain number of levels must be able to affect the target’s and caster’s levels combined, otherwise the spell has no effect on either party. If the ring’s wearer wishes to receive the effects of a targeted spell, he or she must first remove the ring. (Healing spells are exempt, since they are touch-based.)

The presence of the Dark Skull makes any site, building, or structure an unholy site and gains 3 major effects in a 40 ft radius around the skull.<br /><br />First, the structure or site is guarded by a magic circle of protection from good (as the 1st level cleric spell). Next, all turning attempts by good aligned or neutral characters within the structure or site are made at -4, while evil characters gain a +4 bonus to their own turning attempts. Magic resistance does not apply to this effect. Third, the user of the skull may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site. Regardless of the normal parameters for the spell, this usage will last for 1 full year and will be effective throughout the entire site or structure.<br /><br />The user can further designate whether the spell effects will apply to all creatures or creatures of a particular faith or alignment. Though the spell effects lapse after 1 year, they are quickly and easily renewed using the Dark Skull, often as part of an unholy annual ritual. Commonly favoured spells for binding include: <i>cause blindness</i>, <i>chant</i>, <i>curse</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>know alignment</i>, and <i>true seeing</i>; though the choice is up to the user. Saving throws and magic resistance apply normally for these fixed spells.<br /><br />The skull will negate but not dispel a hallowed site with its presence; removing the Dark Skull will restore a holy place to its rightful status.

The owner of the flask can command any extra-planar creature short of demigod power within 60 ft into the flask by speaking the command word. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. The various magic symbols on the flask negate any magic resistance the creature may have, but there is a slight chance (1 in 20) the creature can evade entrapment. Loosing the stopper on the flask frees the creature inside. If the command word is not spoken when the stopper is removed, the creature will react to being freed according to its natural inclination, probably attacking the user. If the command word is spoken when the stopper is removed the creature is bound into the remover’s service for the period of 1 hour, after which it is banished back to its home plane for the period of a year and a day. It is unwise to attempt to recapture the creature at the end of its service; the creature gains a cumulative +2 to its saving throw and will be implacably hostile to the user. This means at the end of its year and a day banishment it will return to deal with its tormentor in any way it sees fit.<br /><br />A newly-discovered bottle may already have a being impri­soned.'],

Any creature within 30 ft of the activated mirror and unaware of the mirror’s true nature will see his or her reflection and be pulled bodily into the mirror. A saving throw vs petrifaction is allowed to avoid imprisonment. The trapped character leaves all carried and worn items behind and will be imprisoned in 1 of 15 extra-planar cells.<br /><br />While imprisoned, the character is in stasis and requires no food, drink or air. He or she loses any innate powers or spell-like abilities. Creatures aware of the mirror’s true nature and seeking to avoid being trapped can approach the mirror and attempt to avoid seeing their reflection with a 50% chance of success; a blindfold or similar increases the chance to 100%. Size is not a factor to the mirror’s trapping ability, but golems and unintelligent undead, as well as any other inanimate matter, cannot be trapped. There are various command words for the <i>mirror of life trapping</i>. Besides the activation command, there is a deactivation command which allows the owner to safely approach the mirror.<br /><br />Each imprisoned creature has two further command words associated with it. One will call the creature’s reflection to the surface of the mirror and allow the owner to converse with the powerless captive. The second command word will free the prisoner. If the number of prisoners held within the mirror exceeds 15, a randomly determined captive will be freed to make room for the new one. Breaking the mirror will free all captives held within—but it should be noted here that not all liberated prisoners may be kindly-disposed towards those who granted them freedom. The GM should determine the quantity and nature of prisoners held by the <i>mirror of life trapping</i> before placing it into the campaign world.'],

The <i>bag of devouring</i> actually has the same capacity for storage as a regular <i>bag of holding</i> but in fact the bag is a lure and feeding orifice for an extradimensional creature. Some say this horror is the result of an evil mage’s twisted experiment on a trapped mimic, or perhaps a doppelgänger, but even the wisest of sages cannot say with any certainty.<br /><br />The <i>bag of devouring</i> senses any intrusion of vegetable or animal matter, such as an adventurer’s arm, into the bag—though 90% of the time it will ignore the initial intrusion. With each subsequent introduction of living material the bag is 60% likely to grab the offending member and attempt to draw the victim inside. The bag is quite strong and the rows of teeth revealed in the attack are designed to allow a struggling creature to move inward easily but outward only with great difficulty. Treat attempts to break free as a Major Test of Strength. The character gets three such attempts; the first when initially grabbed, the second at -10% when halfway inside, the last at -20% before disappearing into the creature’s maw.<br /><br />Any living material drawn into the <i>bag of devouring</i> is entirely consumed in 1 round and thus attempts to raise or resurrect the victim which require a part of the corpse are disallowed. Due to the chaotic and other planar nature of the beast, there is only a 50% chance a wish, miracle, or <i>resurrection</i> will succeed and if that check fails, the victim is irrevocably destroyed.<br /><br />Though the <i>bag of devouring</i> can function somewhat as a <i>bag of holding</i> there is a cumulative 5% chance per hour of the bag swallowing its contents and spitting them out onto some randomly determined plane of existence.'],

The broom gets four attacks at +5 per round, striking twice at the body with the handle and twice in the face with the straw end.

Anyone looking into the ball will be hypnotised for 1d6 minutes, during which time they will do nothing but stare into the ball, enthralled by what is seen therein. When the viewer is released, he or she should roll a save vs petrifaction or be convinced they viewed the desired scene or individual. Further, failing to save indicates the viewer has become mentally enslaved by the actual object of the viewing, a powerful lich, arch-mage, or perhaps even a powerful other planar figure who is secretly controlling the device. With each use of the <i>hypnosis ball</i> the unlucky individual falls deeper and deeper under the influence of the controlling figure, until eventually the viewer becomes an extension of its will.

When unstoppered, the flask releases a gaseous cloud which causes all within 30 ft to roll their constitution or better on 3d6 to avoid being cursed.

If detected for magic, the helm radiates a faint dweomer of indeterminate origin. Once placed upon the head the wearer must save vs polymorph on the spot or immediately change to the alignment diametrically opposed to the wearer’s current alignment. Therefore LG becomes CE, LE becomes CG, and so on. Truly neutral characters will roll 1d4 with 1=LG, 2=CG, 3=LE, 4=CE.<br /><br />This shift in alignment is a complete metamorphosis of heart, mind, and soul and any character undergoing this change will feel as if he or she has just “seen the light” and will strive to the utmost to live life according to this new philosophy. Any attempt to return the character to the original alignment will be viewed with revulsion and resisted by any and all means available. Any character making the saving throw can wear the helm without effect as long as they wish, but if removed and subsequently re-worn another save is required. The <i>helm of opposite alignment</i> loses all magical properties after successfully cursing a character, which means the helm cannot be used to return to one’s original alignment.'],

Instead of reading the thoughts of all creatures within the area of effect, the medallion instead transmits illusory thoughts of a muddled and confusing nature, requiring a save vs spells to focus into coherent thoughts. The false information gained will always seem plausible to the wearer but may, in fact, be dangerously misleading. Unfortunately, while the <i>medallion of thought projection</i> is tricking the user it is also broadcasting the user’s thoughts to all creatures within a cone shaped emanation up to 60 ft in front of the user and alerting them to his or her presence. Thought transmissions can penetrate barriers, but 1 ft of stone, 1 in of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 ft of wood or dirt will block it.'],

This infernal necklace can only be removed with a limited wish, wish, or miracle. Otherwise it will remain clamped around the victim’s throat, even after death.

First, the owner must declare beforehand exactly how many cards he or she wishes to draw from the deck before he or she begins; otherwise he or she will be unable to draw from the deck. Once the number of cards is declared they must be drawn from the deck within an hour of each other. If the character does not draw the declared number of cards from the deck, either willingly or unwillingly, at the end of one hour the specified number of cards will flip out of the deck automatically at the rate of one per turn. Each time a card is drawn it is returned to the deck before drawing again, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.<br /><br />The table following the next one is a listing of the various plaques and their effects, following the table is a more complete description. Included is a corresponding card, both Tarot and common playing card, so the GM can have the player actually draw from a deck.

If successful, the character gains enough xp to gain the next level of advancement.</li><li><b>Donjon:</b> The character is imprisoned, either by some powerful being or as the ninth level magic user spell. The character appears in a cell or holding area with absolutely nothing except his or her skin.

The castle will appear in any open area of the player’s choosing but the decision must be made within an hour of drawing the card.</li><li><b>Vizier:</b> The player acquires the ability to query a deity and receive a truthful answer once, within one year of drawing the card. The information received will be useful for solving the player’s dilemma in question but the player may not always be able to act upon what he or she learns.</li><li><b>The Void:</b> When this completely black card is drawn, an intangible something visibly passes from the player’s face into the card.

The character must roll a save vs death magic, modified by +1 for each point of intelligence over 15, to move the sphere 10 ft per round plus 5 ft for each point he or she exceeded his or her save. Initial control of the sphere can be attempted from as far away as 40 ft and once control is gained the distance the sphere can be controlled increases to 40 ft + 10 ft per controlling character’s level. If a control check fails the sphere slides 10 ft in the direction of the controller who was attempting to move it. Controlling a sphere uses all of a character’s actions for that round.<br /><br />Control of the sphere can be challenged. All creatures attempting to gain control of the sphere roll their saves as above, and the rolls are compared. If all fail their saving throws the sphere moves 10 ft toward the one who rolled the lowest number. If only one saves, he or she gains control of the sphere for 1 round. If more than one (or all) vying for control of the <i>sphere of annihilation</i> make their saving throws, the person exceeding their saving throw by the most number of points gains control.

Therefore spells such as <i>dispel magic</i> and the various protections from magic have no effect on the sphere. There are, however, two exceptions. First, if a <i>rod of cancellation</i> touches the sphere, the incompatibility of the respective connections to the Negative Material Plane will cancel each other with great vigour.

Further, they can levitate their own weight plus an additional weight equal to 30,000 gold pieces two times per day. Storm giants can breathe and otherwise function underwater unimpeded. They are immune to all damage by electricity, including the fearsome electrical bolt breathed by the dreaded blue dragon. There are two typical appearances of storm giants, related to their preference for environment. Those who choose to live under water are often of green hair, eyes and skin, while those above water have purple skin, eyes either purple or cloudy grey, and blue-tinted black hair.'],

Fewer than 50 of these creatures are believed to exist and the secret of their creation process died with the creators—when the spectral trolls rose up in revolt and fed upon their life energy. Spectral trolls are invisible. Anyone able to see invisible will see a monster that appears very much like a shorter-than-normal troll with somewhat indistinct features and glowing amber eyes.\nSpectral trolls have 3 attacks which cause special damage (detailed below) and can target up to 3 different opponents if they choose. Spectral trolls regenerate 3 hit points per round and can rebond severed limbs and, as with their troll brethren, severed limbs will continue to attack independently. These creatures are impervious to cold and cold based attacks while fi re or fi re based attacks cause damage which does not regenerate. Spectral trolls can only be hit by magical weapons.\nSpecial Damage: The spectral troll has two claw attacks that subtract 1d3 points of damage on a successful hit from both the victim’s hp and his or her strength ability score. For example: a 17 strength fi ghter struck for 2 hit points of damage will immediately be reduced to a strength of 15. Strength is recovered at a rate of 1 point for every 2d4 turns. If a victim’s strength is reduced to zero he or she dies; if strength is reduced to 1 or 2 hit points the victim will fall comatose to the ground and will not recover consciousness until enough strength is recovered to raise score to 3 or higher.\nIn addition to the special claw attacks, the spectral troll also has a fanged biting attack. The bite attack of one of these invisible monsters infl icts 1d6 points of damage but the troll adds its own hit  point value as bonus damage to the attack. Example: a spectral troll with 38 hit points bites a cleric for 4 points of damage. Total damage dealt to the unfortunate cleric would 4 + 38 = 42.\nSpectral trolls have an acute sense of smell and superior infravision with a 120 ft range. Like all trolls, the spectral troll is strong, fearless, and attacks relentlessly until it kills its opponent or is itself slain.'],

These devils also have the following special abilities, which they can use one at a time, at will: <i>detect invisibility</i> (as the 2nd level magic user spell), <i>detect magic</i> (as the 1st level magic user spell), <i>hold person</i> (as the 3rd level magic user spell), <i>polymorph self</i> (as the 4th level magic user spell), <i>produce flame</i> (as the 2nd level druid spell), <i>pyrotechnics</i> (as the 2nd level magic user spell), <i>wall of fire</i> (as the 4th level magic user spell), or summon 1d3 barbed devils (60%) or another pit fiend (70%). Once per day, a pit fiend can use a <i>symbol of pain</i> (as the 7th level cleric spell).'],

This sundering of their metaphysical essence creates a foul thing, roaming dark and desolate places, existing in both the æthereal plane and the prime material, seeking to slake a thirst that can never be sated. This exigent need for living essences is what drives these spirits into contact with mortals.<br /><br />Merely beholding the awfulness of the ghost requires a saving throw vs magic. Failure causes the viewer to flee in panic (for 2d8 turns) and initiates a weaker form of the ghost’s <i>wither</i> attack—which ages the victim 3d6 years as the ghost feasts on the life of the victim.<br /><br />Clerics level 7 or greater can ignore this effect, as they have a better understanding of how to ward off such metaphysical forces, while other intelligences with 9 or more hit dice or levels gain a +3 to their saves.<br /><br />Until the ghost manifests itself physically, it is immune to all attacks, spell or no, unless the attacker has a method to become æthereal. Even if the spellcaster is in this state, ghosts are still immune to many forms of spells, though no sage has recorded what those magics might be. Magical weapons used in an æthereal state against a ghost typically have to strike against AC 7 or 8.<br /><br />As if these terrible powers were not enough, any creature within 180 ft is threatened by the being’s <i>magic jar</i> ability, as per the spell. If this fails, then the ghost will manifest itself, taking on an ectoplasmic quality. Specially forged “pure” metals, especially silver, can cause half-damage to a ghost while it is manifested in this fashion, and magic weapons can affect it normally—in either case the attacker must hit AC 0. Spells still cannot affect it in this state unless the caster is æthereal. The manifest state allows the ghost to strike victims physically, with the full power of their <i>withering</i> attack—causing the victim to age 7d6 years per successful attack, no save possible. Victims who exceed their allotted lifespan are forever dead, with only a wish capable of reversing this end.'],

Their souls are already traded to dark gods, but a spark of their essence remains that must be encased in a talisman of sorts. This trinket is a requirement of their Unlife, but no scholar knows how or why this is.<br /><br />The lair of a lich will often be a complex underworld maze or a wickedly diseased stretch of thick wilderness, at whose black heart resides a tower riddled with magic traps and deadly guardians. Liches do not suffer the fools who would tread upon their mysteries.<br /><br />Each lich will be able to cast an impressive battery of spells, and those with magic user abilities will have multiple copies of powerful spell tomes.

For each month of affliction, the victim permanently loses 2 points of charisma, and while diseased no <i>cure wound</i> spells will have any effect and any wounds will naturally heal at a 10% rate. The mummy rot can only be cured by a <i>cure disease</i> spell.<br /><br />All creatures within 60 ft of a mummy, upon sight, will suffer the effects of fear and revulsion unless a successful saving throw vs magic is made.

Groups of creatures gain a bonus of +1 for their save at a ratio of six creatures for each mummy (for example: 12 creatures in sight of 1 mummy gain a +2 to save; 12 creatures in sight of 2 mummies gain a +1, and 12 creatures within sight of 3 or more mummies gain no bonus). If humans confront a mummy, then each human will gain a +2 to his or her save.<br /><br />A mummy cannot be harmed by normal weapons, and magical weapons do only half damage (drop all fractions). A mummy is immune to <i>sleep</i>, <i>hold</i> spells, <i>charm</i> spells, and cold based attacks. Poison and paralysis have no effect on the creature.

So far as is known, all poltergeists were formerly human or at least half-human. They are only rarely encountered as a wandering monster but in such a case can be treated as a type 1 undead for purposes of turning or disrupting. More often, however, the poltergeist is in the area where it met its untimely end. The poltergeist’s bond to this area is strong and turning is much more difficult, treat the poltergeist as a turning a type 3 undead in this case.<br /><br />In combat, the poltergeist can only be struck by magical or silver weapons and its invisibility will cause all attacks against it to be made at -4 (unless the attacker can <i>see invisible</i>). It will not cross over sprinkled holy water, though after the holy water dries it is no longer effective at warding them. Holy water does not cause actual harm to poltergeists. A cleric can strongly present a holy symbol to keep them at bay as well, but again this does not harm the creature.<br /><br />Poltergeists cannot physically attack. Instead they hurl objects with a telekinetic power at their opponents, attacking as a 5 HD monster. These objects must be light enough to be thrown by a standard human; books, torches, lamps, chairs and so on. A poltergeist’s lair will include many such objects. Anyone struck takes no damage, but he or she must save vs spells or flee at top movement speed for 2d12 rounds. A fleeing victim has a 50% for dropping whatever is held in his or her hands, but not necessarily right away. When a PC succumbs to the poltergeist’s fear effect, determine how many rounds he or she will flee, then roll the dice again to determine on which round hand held items will be dropped.

Their ties to the negative material plane cause living things they hit in melee to lose a point of Str, Dex or Con.

Cold attacks are useless, as are sleep, hold, and spells that affect the mind.

The living in turn can only affect spectres with magic weapons (of at least +1 value) or spells. Elemental spells and enchantments that affect the mind have no power over spectres. Liquids blessed by the gods still inflict damage upon them. If a cleric (good or evil) attempts to restore a spectre back to life via a spell or ritual, the spectre must make a saving throw or its existence is removed from the plane that fuels its Unlife and it becomes naught in the world of living.<br /><br />Some sages speculate that spectres have no power in sunlight, but no one has ever proved this theory.'],

Being similar to other undead, they dwell simultaneously in the negative material and material planes. They share other undead’s immunity to <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, and <i>sleep</i> spells. Electricity and cold does only half damage, they are unaffected by normal weapons, and they regenerate 3 hit points per round. Vampires must take refuge in a coffin or other hideaway during daylight, and must slumber on soil from their own grave once in a while to maintain their powers.<br /><br />Vampires are immensely strong (18.76), and deal great blows that inflict 1d6+4 hit points of damage. These blows further reduce the victim’s life energy by two levels, which consequently reduces all other traits linked to a loss in levels (attack ability, hit dice, etc.).<br /><br />Vampires may take gaseous form at will, and will be forced into this form if their hit points reach zero. They then attempt to reach their coffin to reform their bodies. If they do not reach the coffin within 12 turns and rest for 8 hours, they are unable to reform.<br /><br />Further, vampires may <i>shape change</i> into a large bat at will, which grants them flying movement. They can summon 1d10×10 bats or rats when underground or 3d6 wolves when above. These creatures will arrive in 2d6 rounds. In addition, a vampire has a <i>charm</i> gaze (as the <i>charm person</i> spell), with a saving throw penalty of -2.<br /><br />Although these items do not actually cause harm or completely repel these creatures, vampires will draw back from a lawful good holy symbol, a mirror, or garlic if they are presented with confidence. Garlic causes a vampire to cringe for 1d4 rounds, and a holy symbol or mirror will cause a vampire to take a position in which the item does not impede his or her progress or attack. A lawful good holy symbol will affect a vampire no matter what its ethos was in life. Once a person becomes a vampire, he or she is a chaotic evil undead creature. Holy water will inflict 1d6+1 points of damage per full vial which strikes.<br /><br />There are few means by which a vampire may be destroyed. They take great damage from immersion in running water, and will be killed in 3 rounds (each round reduces 1/3 of the creature’s hit points). If caught in sunlight a vampire becomes powerless and will die in 1 turn. Finally, a stake through the heart, coupled with decapitation, will destroy a vampire if holy sacraments (such as wafers) are placed in the mouth after the head is removed. If a vampire is staked he or she will appear to die, but unless also decapitated the vampire will revive when the stake is removed.<br /><br />Vampires create others of their kind by draining humans or humanoids of all life energy. The victim must be buried. After 1 day he or she will arise as a vampire. The victim will retain class abilities he or she had in life but will become a chaotic evil undead being. The new vampire is a slave to the vampire that created him or her, but becomes free willed if the master is killed.<br /><br />There is a variant type of vampire from the east, which cannot assume <i>gaseous form</i> at will (but will if reduced to zero hit points), nor does it have a <i>charm</i> gaze.

These creatures are then completely subservient to their master, who can issue commands to them to guard, attack, or patrol an area, or other similar orders. Juju zombies are like regular zombies but are improved in virtually every way. This type of zombie moves more quickly, has an improved AC, climbs with the skill of an 8th level thief, attack as 6 HD monsters, use missile weapons such as crossbows or pulled bows, and can even use hurled weapons such as spears or javelins.<br /><br />In combat, juju zombies attack with their clawed hands but they can be programmed to use weapons by their master. Due to their strong connection to the Negative Material Plane, juju zombies can only be hit by magic weapons.

If both claw attacks are successful the tiger has grabbed its victim and gains two additional attacks at +4 to hit from its powerful rear legs for 1d6+2 points of damage each. There is a 25% chance a tiger met in its lair will have 1d3 cubs. In such a case, the tiger will fight to the death to defend them.

Tigers are ruthless and efficient predators, often hunting in pairs or family groups, surrounding their prey and attacking as one. Tigers can climb trees as easily as walking on the ground, leap 40 ft to attack from hiding, move silently at quarter speed in natural settings, and spring upwards 10 ft. Tigers attack with a claw-claw-bite routine. If both claw attacks are successful the tiger has grabbed its victim and gains two additional attacks at +4 to hit from its powerful rear legs for 1d6+2 points of damage each.

When not defending its young, a tiger generally avoids contact with humans and demi-humans.<br /><br />Smilodons or sabre-toothed tigers are dangerous and aggressive. These giant cats are generally found in “lost world” type areas with dinosaurs and cave men, but they are sometimes encountered in more standard settings as well. Sabre-tooth tigers conform to their smaller cousins in most respects, including the rear leg bonus attacks (2 × 2d4 points of damage). Smilodon fangs are long and sharp, backed by powerful jaw muscles; these factors combine to give the sabre-tooth a +2 to hit probability for its bite attack.'],

The aerial servant will not fight, but will find and bring to the caster whatever creature or object the caster describes (provided the task is within the aerial servant’s capacity to complete). The aerial servant will return to its native plane of existence at the end of the spell’s duration, and earlier if the cleric who summoned it is slain, if the cleric releases the creature from its bondage, or if the servant is banished. When summoning an aerial servant, the cleric must be protected by a protection from evil spell or a holy symbol, or must stand within a magic circle. If the summoner does not take these precautions, the aerial servant will not be subject to any sort of control and will immediately attack the one who called it forth.\n\nWhen fetching forth a living subject, the aerial servant always gains the benefit of surprise on its first attack for 4 surprise segments (unless it is detected). When the aerial servant scores a hit, it has successfully grabbed hold of its target and may bring it back to the cleric if the aerial servant is stronger than its victim. To determine the result of this test of strength, both the aerial servant and its victim roll their hit dice (using the proper die type), and the higher number wins.'],
        ['animate_dead','Animate Dead','no','cleric','Necromancy','3','N/A','10\'','Permanent','Special','V,S,M','1 round','None','Animate Dead calls the bones or bodies of dead humans or humanoids to rise and become lesser undead (skeletons or zombies). The undead will obey their creator’s simple commands, following him or her, or perhaps guarding a location he or she designates against any creature (or not guarding it against certain creatures) that might enter. The spell’s effects are permanent, but can be dispelled by the use of dispel magic. Use of this spell is inherently not in accordance with the good alignment and is seldom used by good clerics unless there is pressing need. Moreover, casting the spell in the confines of a city may subject the caster to inquiry by secular and religious authorities alike. A cleric may animate one zombie or skeleton per caster level. '],

The GM will determine an object’s speed and combat specifics. An object’s mode of locomotion will determine its speed: rocking (a pedestal or bookshelf) at 10 ft/round, slithering (rope, carpet) at 10-30 ft per round, walking (statue, table) at 40-80 ft/ round, scampering (footstool) at 120 ft/ round. The object’s mode of attack (binding, striking, falling upon) and damage must be adjudicated by the GM’s common sense, although as a guideline, an item of approximately human weight will be able to strike for 2d4 hit points of damage.'],
        ['astral_spell','Astral Spell','no','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','7','N/A','Touch','Special','Special','V,S','3 turns','None','Casting an astral spell allows the cleric and up to five companions to leave their material bodies and travel through the astral plane to other planes of existence. As the spell is cast, the character’s material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the cleric may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a “silver cord,” an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form.\n\nMost magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane. Unless an item’s magical qualities are imbued so deeply as to exist in many planes, an astral traveller’s physical manifestation on another plane will be equipped with only the unenchanted substance of otherwise magic items and weapons.'],
        ['atonement','Atonement','no','cleric','Abjuration','5','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','1 person','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The atonement spell is a form of spiritual cleansing, removing the stain of actions contrary to a character’s moral alignment, but only for actions that the penitent took unwillingly or unwittingly. The penitent must be truly repentant of the deed, unless he or she is affected in such a way that would preclude repentance (such as in the case of someone whose alignment has been magically altered, or who is unconscious, charmed, or insane). In addition to removing the effects and supernatural consequences of evil actions, this spell may be used to negate, undo, or dispel a magical alignment change. Intentional misdeeds cannot be cleansed away by this spell. A cleric can, of course, use this spell to perform atonements for unintentional acts of goodness as well as evil, or for violations of neutral alignment. However, unless the GM rules otherwise based on circumstances, a cleric who is not true neutral cannot perform atonements for an alignment that the cleric does not, in some part, share.'],
        ['augury','Augury','no','cleric','Divination','2','N/A','Caster','Instantaneous','Caster','V,S,M','2 rounds','None','Casting an augury allows the cleric to discern minor omens, indications of what might be in the future. The spell requires a focal point that will allow the omens to manifest—a set of sticks made from dragon’s bone or gold is the most common focus for the spell. It is possible to  derive omens from tea leaves, but a pearl worth 100 gp must be crushed into the infusion. The divination power of an augury is not strong; it will only gather omens from the pattern of the next 3 turns (30 minutes), and can only indicate whether a future action will result in weal or woe to the party. The base chance for correctly interpreting the omens is 70% plus an additional 1% per level of the caster.'],
        ['blade_barrier','Blade Barrier','no','cleric','Evocation','6','8d8','30\'','3 rounds/caster level','Circular path 2-10 ft in radius','V,S','9 segments','None','This enchantment brings into being a whirling wall of steel blades that circle around a fixed point with blinding speed. Any creature stepping through the circle will suffer 8d8 points of damage. The cleric sets the focal point and the radius of the barrier at the time of casting, and these parameters cannot be changed thereafter (short of dismissing the spell entirely, of course).'],
        ['bless','Bless','yes','cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','1','N/A','60\'','6 rounds','50 × 50 ft','V,S,M','1 round','None','This minor benison raises the morale and attack rolls of any creatures allied with the casting cleric by +1 or +5% as appropriate. Any creatures already engaged in melee combat will not gain the spell’s benefits. The spell is reversible, allowing the cleric to curse his or her enemies with—5% morale and –1 to hit.\n\nThe spell’s area of effect is a circular area centred at the target point, which cannot be more than 60 ft from the cleric. Holy water is required to cast the spell (unholy water for the reverse).'],
        ['chant','Chant','no','cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','2','N/A','0','Indefinite (duration of chant)','30 ft radius centred on caster','V,S','1 turn','None','Once the spell is cast, the cleric must maintain a sonorous chanting of holy words and prayers, which not only lend divine favour to the cleric and his or her allies but also bring disfavour to their foes. For so long as the cleric remains stationary and continues to chant, his or her allies (within the area of effect) gain a bonus of +1 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Enemies within the spell’s area of effect also suffer a –1 to all such die rolls. If the cleric sustains damage, is grappled, or is in some way silenced, the effect of the spell will end.'],
        ['command','Command','no','cleric','Enchantment/Charm','1','N/A','10\'','1 round','1 living creature','V','1 segment','See Description','By speaking a single word of command with the force of divine power behind it, the cleric may force a creature to obey an order. The creature must be able to hear the cleric and understand the language in which he or she utters the command. The command may be only one word, must be a verb, and must be completely unambiguous. “Halt,” “Flee,” and “Sleep” are typical commands, but many others are possible. The effects may not extend beyond a single round, and the command “Die” has the same effect as the command to “Sleep”.\n\nCreatures with intelligence of 13+ and/or hit dice of 6+ gain a saving throw against the spell’s influence.'],
        ['commune','Commune','no','cleric','Divination','5','N/A','Caster','3 rounds (limited number of questions)','See Description','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The commune spell establishes a mystical link between the cleric and his or her deity, permitting the cleric to ask one yes or no question per caster level. This extraordinarily powerful divination spell does not involve any chance of the cleric’s misinterpretation of omens, for the spiritual communion with the deity is direct and not conveyed through symbols or portents. It is likely that a cleric who resorts to this spell too frequently, or for matters not worthy of the god’s attention, may fall from divine favour enough that he or she loses the ability to cast the spell, at least for a time.'],
        ['conjure_animals','Conjure Animals','no','cleric','Conjuration/Summoning','6','N/A','30\'','2 rounds/caster level','Conjured creatures','V,S','9 segments','None','A cleric may use this spell to conjure animal allies from thin air and order them into combat. The total hit dice of summoned animals cannot exceed the cleric’s level, and the animals must all be of the same type. This spell will only summon mammals, although giant or prehistoric forms of normal mammals may be conjured if these are present within a few miles of the caster. The GM determines the specifi c type of animal that appears.'],
        ['continual_light','Continual Light','yes','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','3','N/A','120\'','Permanent','60 ft radius globe','V,S','6 segments','See Description','This spell brings into being a bright, magical illumination almost sufficient to rival the light of day. In some respects the spell is identical to the first level cleric spell light , but its effects are permanent until dispelled. The light cast is greater than that produced by a light spell, extending 60 ft into the darkness. The reverse of the spell, continual darkness , produces an ink-like darkness in the same 60 ft area and negates the illumination of a continual light spell if one is present.\n\nBy casting the spell upon an enemy’s eyes or other organs of sight, the caster may blind the spell’s subject, causing the same penalties as if the creature were blinded by a light spell. In this instance, a saving throw is permitted, and if it is successful the spell’s effect will centre upon the area immediately behind the targeted creature.'],
        ['control_weather_cleric','Control Weather','no','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','7','N/A','0','4d12 hours','4d4 square miles','V,S,M','1 turn','None','The control weather spell brings about a rapid change in the weather for several square miles surrounding the point where the spell is cast. It requires no more than 10-40 minutes for the spell to take its full effect across the vast area it covers. The spell affects precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. Existing weather conditions cannot be utterly changed by the force of this spell; a clear day cannot be made cloudy, for instance, but it can be made partly cloudy. Hot weather can be made merely warm, and only a light breeze can be raised from calm weather.\n\nThis spell may be cast successively to bring about a dramatic change, moving, for example, from a calm to a light breeze, from the breeze to a strong wind, and on the third casting to transform the strong wind into a gale.'],
        ['create_food_and_water','Create Food and Water','no','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','3','N/A','10\'','Instantaneous (permanent)','A day’s ration per caster level','V,S','1 turn','None','Upon completion of the ritual words of this spell, food and/or water will appear from thin air. A caster of fi fth level can conjure up enough food and water to sustain a person or even a horse for fi ve full days. The volume of food and water produced by the spell is approximately one cubic ft per level of the caster.'],
        ['create_water','Create Water','yes','cleric','Transmutation/Alteration','1','N/A','10\'','Instantaneous (permanent)','Up to 30 cubic ft','V,S,M','1 round','None','This spell creates potable water, four gallons per level of the caster. The water may be created in a receptacle or in thin air (whence it will, of course, fall). Water cannot be created inside a creature, nor can it be created in any place the caster cannot see. The reverse of the spell destroys water (including fog, steam, mist, etc.) in the same quantities as create water.'],
        ['cure_blindness','Cure Blindness','yes','cleric','Abjuration','3','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','1 round','None (Negate)','This powerful spell allows the cleric permanently to remove virtually all forms of blindness. The reverse of the spell permits a saving throw, and the cleric must successfully touch the spell’s intended target to inflict blindness (permanent duration).'],
        ['cure_critical_wounds','Cure Critical Wounds','yes','cleric','Necromancy','5','3d8+3','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','8 segments','None (Negate)','This powerful spell is similar in nature to cure light wounds, operating in the same fashion but healing 3d8+3 hit points of damage. The reverse of the spell functions as cause critical wounds, but delivers 3d8+3 points of damage.'],
        ['cure_disease','Cure Disease','yes','cleric','Abjuration','3','N/A','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','1 turn','None (Negate)','By means of this spell, the cleric may cure most diseases by laying hands upon the afflicted creature. Depending upon the nature of the disease, full recovery may require as little time as a single turn, or as long as a week. The spell’s reverse, cause disease, requires that the cleric successfully touch the intended victim, who is permitted a saving throw against the spell’s insidious effects. If the saving throw is failed, the effects of the disease will manifest within 1d6 turns, inflicting 1 hit point of damage per turn thereafter and one point of lost strength per hour (6 turns) until the victim is reduced to 10% of his or her original hit points and strength. Until the disease is cured or runs its course, the afflicted person will not be able to naturally recover either strength or hit points over and above 10%. The disease runs its course in 1d6 days.'],
        ['cure_light_wounds','Cure Light Wounds','yes','cleric','Necromancy','1','1d8','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','5 segments','None (Negate)','Cure light wounds allows the cleric to lay hands upon a wounded creature, restoring 1d8 hit points to the spell’s beneficiary. The reverse of the spell operates in the same manner (although requiring a to hit roll), but inflicts 1d8 hit points rather than healing. If the cleric fails to hit while casting cause light wounds, the spell is lost. This spell does not heal disease, reattach limbs, or bring back the dead, nor can it add hit points beyond a character’s normal number. Non-corporeal creatures are not affected by this spell, nor are undead, nor are creatures that are harmed only by iron, silver, or magical weapons.'],
        ['cure_serious_wounds','Cure Serious Wounds','yes','cleric','Necromancy','4','2d8+1','Touch','Instantaneous (permanent)','Creature touched','V,S','7 segments','None (Negate)','A benison similar to cure light wounds, cure serious wounds permits the cleric to lay on hands for 2d8+1 hit points of healing. The spell’s limits are otherwise similar to those of cure light wounds. The reverse of the spell causes damage rather than healing, requiring that the cleric successfully touch the target.'],

The enchantment affects surfaces, with the caster being able to ward up to 5 ft x 5 ft of wall, floor, door, etc., per caster level. The cleric writes or otherwise inscribes the surface to be protected with the glyph of his choice, thereby defining what effect the glyph will have when discharged. He or she then traces the area to be affected with incense and, if the area to be covered exceeds 50 sq ft, he or she must also sprinkle it with at least 2,000 gp worth of powdered gems to bind the spell over such a large area. When the spell is completed, the glyph and the tracery of its area fade from sight and remain invisible thereafter until the spell is discharged. Any being touching the protected surface without speaking the name of the glyph will discharge the glyph’s power. Depending upon the nature of the glyph, a successful saving throw will either reduce the damage by one-half or negate the glyph’s effects entirely. The amount of power that can be held within a glyph depends upon the caster’s level. Most glyphs cause physical damage from fire or other elemental energies, causing 2 hit points of damage per caster level. More powerful glyphs are known that can induce paralysis or drain experience levels, although these are clearly the province only of the most powerful clerics.

No saving throw applies, but a successful attack is required. In addition to restoring lost levels, the spell can affect other sorts of magically-induced debilities. The effects of a feeblemind spell are reversed by restoration, for example.'],

Elves cannot be resurrected, having no souls, but humans and the rest of their ilk (half-elves, dwarfs, etc.) can be affected.

A poisoned creature will lose 1 hit point per turn (but will not fall below 1) during the spell’s duration; once the spell’s protection expires, the victim will suffer the full potency of the poison.

Depending upon the nature of the conversation, if the animal’s alignment is neutral or of the same tendency as the cleric’s, the animal may be disposed to help the cleric in some manner. It is important to note that the spell does not permit speech with animals of monstrous or unnatural nature; communication with a monster such as a cockatrice, for example, is beyond the spell’s power.

When the caster invokes this spell, he or she becomes able to communicate with and understand the “speech” of normal animals (with the exception of mindless creatures). While the spell lasts, the animal (and any other animals of the same type in its company) will refrain from attacking, even if they were initially hostile. Depending upon the nature of the conversation, if the animal’s alignment is neutral or of the same tendency as the druid’s, the animal may be disposed to help the druid in some manner. It is important to note that the spell does not permit speech with animals of monstrous or unnatural nature; communication with a monster such as a cockatrice, for example, is beyond the spell’s power. Neither does the spell suddenly imbue an animal with intelligence; the observations and opinions of an animal such as a badger will be appropriate to the animal’s own experiences, motives, and intellectual limitations.'],

A flying swarm can move tremendously fast, but a crawling swarm is limited to movement of 12 ft/ round. In either case, the insects automatically inflict 2 hp damage per round against their target, and the unfortunate victim will be so thickly covered as to be incapable of any action, including movement.

Similarly, if a floor is turned to mud, creatures standing in the area will sink and may be trapped. If dispel magic is cast upon the mud before it eventually dries into dirt, the mud will return to stone, but in the shape and location of the mud (i.e., a collapsed ceiling will not return to its original place; it will be frozen back into stone where it collapsed).

He or she may remain in the first plant for up to 24 hours, but at any time he or she may step forth from another plant of the same species in another location. The druid may know of a specific plant from which he or she wants to emerge, or may simply specify a distance and a direction.

The trap causes falls to be much worse than normal: a running creature will suffer 1d6 points of damage and be stunned for 1d4+1 rounds, or will merely be stunned if they fall onto a soft surface such as grass.

One side of the conflagration emits the searing heat one would expect, but the other side emits merely a gentle warmth. Passing through the flames inflicts 4d4 damage plus 1/ caster level. Creatures as far as ten ft from the hot side of the wall incur 2d4 hit points of damage, and even creatures as far as 20 ft from the fire are burned for 1d4 points of damage. Undead creatures suffer worse from the power of this druidic magic, taking twice the ordinary damage the wall would inflict. The wall persists for as long as the druid concentrates upon it, or, if the druid does not choose to maintain concentration, will remain for 1 round/ caster level. The druid may evoke a wall of fire in one of two shapes: a wall or a ring. The size of a straight wall is up to one 20 ft square per caster level. A ring has a radius of up to five ft per caster level (with the caster in the centre) and is 20 ft high. If the druid manifests the spell as a wall, the effect is stationary.

A creature may be caught within the wall of thorns when the spell is cast, and if this is the case it will take damage immediately and must fight through (taking damage a second time) to gain enough freedom of motion to chop at the thorns. It takes four turns to cut through a 40 ft thickness of a wall of thorns.\n\nNormal fire has no effect upon a wall of thorns, but magical fire can ignite the entire growth, creating a wall of fire (as per the spell) that burns away to nothing in two turns.'],

Existing weather conditions cannot be utterly changed by the force of this spell; a clear day cannot be made cloudy, for instance, but it can be made partly cloudy. Hot weather can be made merely warm, and only a light breeze can be raised from calm weather.\n\nThis spell may be cast successively to bring about a dramatic change, moving, for example, from a calm to a light breeze, from the breeze to a strong wind, and on the third casting to transform the strong wind into a gale.'],

The spell’s effects are permanent, but can be dispelled by the use of dispel magic. Use of this spell is inherently not in accordance with the good alignment and is seldom used by good magic users unless there is pressing need.

The drawback of an anti-magic shell, of course, is that the caster him- or herself cannot cast spells or avail him- or herself of magic items while inside. Magic weapons, armour, and the like do not gain their bonuses or abilities while inside the shell, but would still function as non-magical weapons or armour.'],

If the magic user creates an antipathy for the area or object, the targeted creature type will feel an intense desire to stay away from it. A saving throw applies, permitting the creature to remain, or to touch the object, but even if the saving throw is successful the creature will feel extremely uncomfortable in its presence. Creatures that are able to remain in the area or near the object will begin to lose 1 point of dexterity per round (maximum 4 points) from discomfort.\n\nIf the magic user creates sympathy for an object or area, on the other hand, the targeted creature type will feel attracted to the area or object, pleased to remain in the vicinity, or covetous of the “precious” item.

As the spell is cast, the character’s material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the magic user may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a “silver cord,” an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form.\n\nMost magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane.

The spell can create any type of sound, but the maximum volume of the noise depends upon the caster’s level. A third level caster can produce the noise of 4 people shouting (or acting more quietly). Each additional caster level allows the caster to add the sound of four more people into the illusion. As a benchmark, the sound of an explosion or landslide would require a caster level of approximately 8th. Listeners are only entitled to saving throws if they have cause to doubt the apparent sounds.

For the duration of the spell, the magic user teleports 2 ft in a random direction once per round. The segment in which the magic user disappears and reappears is determined on 2d4, while the compass direction is rolled on a d8. If the direction roll would result in the caster being teleported into a solid object, the caster will blink a second time, for a distance of no more than 10 ft. If this second blink also results in the caster occupying a solid object, the spell will end, marooning the caster in the æthereal plane of existence. During and after the segment in which the teleportation occurs, the magic user’s sudden change of location prevents any direct attacks upon him or her. The caster may only be attacked directly if the attack is made before the blink takes place. If the caster teleports both from and into an area which is affected by an area of effect spell, he will suffer its effects. The constant changes of location take a toll upon the caster, who has a 25% chance of failing at attempts to cast spells, use most magic items, or take any action beyond making physical attacks.'],

In order to cast the spell, the caster must know the fiend’s true name, but such information is often contained in forbidden tomes of lost lore. The spell cannot summon the lesser sorts of demons that have no personal names, nor is it powerful enough to summon members of the demonic or diabolical nobility. The spell provides no protection whatsoever against the wrath of the summoned creature—and make no mistake, the summoned creature will be extremely resentful of the caster’s temerity.\n\nIn general, this spell is cast only with multiple protections against the summoned fiend, such as a pentacle to contain the demon and a magic circle to protect the magic user. The exact nature of any discussions or negotiations with creatures of the nether planes is, of course, a matter to be handled in the course of the game, with the GM deciding what the fiend is thinking and how it acts.\n\nIt is treacherous in the extreme to deal with demons, for they are intelligent and ruthless. They are not, however, unreliable; since the caster knows the fiend’s true name, it is compelled to abide by any agreements it might make, although it might be able to twist the spirit of the agreement while still abiding to the letter of it.\n\nCertain spells (spirit-rack or trap the soul, for example) can be (and often are) used to strengthen the magic user’s hand in any negotiations with a demon.'],

Indeed, a familiar can also be of considerable benefit to a lower level magic user (even increasing others’ estimation of his or her power), but the risks inherent in losing a familiar can be daunting to a weaker spell caster. To summon a familiar, the magic user must intone the words of the spell over a well-stocked fire source, sprinkling the flames with expensive incense and powders (100 gp in total value). The caster must maintain his or her casting for as long as necessary (2d12 hours) until a familiar arrives (or the casting time expires without success). The spell may be attempted only once per year, and the caster has no control over the type of animal that will respond. When it arrives, the familiar is a faithful servant and ally to the caster. Normal familiars have 1d3+1 hit points, are AC 7, and are as intelligent as a lower-than-average human. When the familiar is within 120 ft of the magic user, the magic user gains additional hit points equal to the familiar’s. However, if the familiar is ever killed, the magic user permanently loses twice the familiar’s hit points.\n\nCaster Level\n  1-2    3-5     6-8     9-11  12-14  15+   Familiar\n----------------------------------------------\n01-05 01-05 01-06 01-06 01-07 01-07 Special\n06-25 06-25 07-29 07-29 08-33 08-33 Cat\n26-35 26-36 30-40 30-41 34-45 34-46 Hawk\n36-45 37-47 41-51 42-53 46-57 47-59 Owl\n46-55 48-58 52-62 54-65 58-69 60-72 Raven\n56-65 59-69 63-73 66-77 70-81 73-85 Toad\n66-75 70-80 74-84 78-89 82-93 86-98 Weasel\n76-00 81-00 85-00 90-00 94-00 99-00 None\n\nA special familiar is entitled to a saving throw in order to avoid the effect of the spell.

When the magic user casts the spell, a bead of light streaks from his or her pointed finger to the target area, and if it strikes another object directly in its path the fireball will detonate immediately. The blast fills the entire volume of the spell radius, and if it is cast into an enclosed area smaller than the area of effect the flames will expand from this area until the spell’s full volume has been reached. The volume of a 20 ft radius sphere is approximately 33,500 cubic ft, and there are 1,000 cubic ft in a 10 × 10 × 10 ft area, so in an area with a 10 ft ceiling the fireball will fill approximately thirty-three 10 × 10 ft squares. Thus, if a fireball explodes in the middle of a corridor 10 ft wide and 10 ft high, the blast will extend a staggering 165 ft in both directions. It is quite possible, particularly in dungeoneering environments, for the magic user to be caught in the backblast of his or her own fireball spell.

If either spell is cast upon a living creature, the creature is entitled to a saving throw (success indicating that the spell affects the area just behind the creature). A light spell cast upon a creature’s eyes will blind it for the spell’s duration, causing it a penalty of -4 on all rolls to hit if sight is its primary sense.

The bolt deals 1d6 damage per caster level to all creatures standing in the bolt’s area of effect. Creatures that make successful saving throws suffer half damage. The area of effect may be either a branching, forking maelstrom of electricity 10 ft wide and 40 ft long, or it may be a concentrated blast 5 ft wide and 80 ft long. The length of the bolt itself is not affected by the caster’s level, only the range at which the caster may cause the bolt to originate.\n\nAll items hit by the full force of the bolt must make item saving throws or be destroyed. The force of the bolt is often sufficient to blast doors into smouldering ruin. If the bolt strikes an object that does not conduct electricity, such as a stone wall, it will be deflected backward toward the caster (potentially inflicting a second shock upon those in the target area).

It cannot bring the dead back to life, grant a level, or permanently change ability scores. In many cases, the GM will be called upon to determine whether the caster’s wish is within the power of a limited wish spell or whether the results of the request will suffer from flaws due to the spell’s limitations. Flaws would include limited durations or partial results. The guidelines set forth above should give the GM some assistance in making such determinations.\n\nIn the case of unreasonable wishes, the GM may decide to follow the wording of the spell precisely but pervert the intent, limit the duration of the spell to a very limited time (perhaps mere seconds!) or simply rule that the whole spell fails.\n\nThe guideline here is that wishes are granted by someone or something, which may or may not be kindly disposed to the player characters.

The spell is directional, requiring the magic user to turn in different directions in order to sense an object in his or her path. The magic user may move after casting the spell to search a broader area, and need not be in actual line of sight of the object.

The GM may adjust the amount by which the spell affects other substances based upon the difference of their material properties from those of water. The spell’s area of effect is a square with sides measuring 10 ft per level of the magic user. For example, a magic user of 7th level can affect a square area up to 70 × 70 ft.

If any creature larger than a cat or small dog enters the area, the hound will begin baying with its echoing, supernatural bark.

To accomplish the transfer of souls, the magic user must trap his or her own life essence within the jar prior to the transfer. If the transfer fails (e.g., if the targeted creature makes a successful saving throw), the caster’s soul is trapped until it can take over a host or otherwise escape.\n\nThe caster can make successive attempts to take over the same host, but no more than one per round. The spell’s range applies to two matters; when the magic user first transfers his or her own life essence into the jar, his or her body must be within the spell’s range of the jar. The range also limits the distance at which the magic user’s soul may later escape from the jar and into another body. After the caster’s soul moves into the jar, his or her physical body becomes inert and lifeless.\n\nThe spell represents, in many ways, a contest of will between the magic user and the creature whose body he or she seeks to possess. The caster and the target creature each total their intelligence and wisdom scores (such being calculated or approximated by the GM for a monster). This combined score represents the character’s mental power for purposes of the spell. The two numbers are compared, and the difference is used in two important calculations: the saving throw and the chance for escape. One third of the difference (rounded down) is the modifier on the saving throw, a bonus if the target creature has the higher mental power, a penalty if the magic user’s mental power is higher.\n\nIf a creature’s soul is trapped in the magic jar by the caster, it has a chance to escape. If it escapes, the caster’s soul is returned to the magic jar. If the difference in mental power between the caster and the possessed creature is 4 or less in favour of the caster, or is in favour of the possessed creature, the creature can attempt a new saving throw every round. If the difference is from 5 to 8 in the caster’s favour, one saving throw is permitted per turn. If the difference is 9 to 12 in the caster’s favour, the saving throw is made once per day, and if the caster’s mental power exceeds that of the target creature by 13+, the saving throw can only be made once per week.\n\nWhile the caster is in the magic jar waiting to possess another body, he or she can sense creatures beyond the jar, but not their nature. The jar may be moved from its original location, but not, obviously, by the caster. When the caster possesses another body, he or she gains complete control of its movement and acquires any memories that the body might reflexively recall (how to fly, fight with claws, use innate magical powers, etc). He or she does not gain any knowledge from the creature’s mind, such as languages known or the location of a lair, for the mind is trapped in the magic jar. The caster retains his or her own mind while possessing the other body, so if the body possesses the correct physical attributes the caster can continue to cast his or her spells from within the new body.'],

A demon wielding a sword can attack and do damage, and the appearance of a pit full of spikes can be fatal even though it is not real.

When the magic user casts the spell, one hand upon the chest and one upon the miniature, the chest disappears into the æthereal plane, together with its contents.

To cast the spell, the magic user must know the fiendish creature’s name, and inscribe it into a scroll, the preparation of which requires 8d6 hours and the expenditure of at least 5,000 gp. Once the spell is cast, if the scroll is read aloud by the caster in the fiend’s presence it will have the effects described below. A caster can create no more than one scroll for any particular fiend and can only keep three such scrolls in existence at any one time; the magic of one will fade if a fourth is created.\n\nWhen the caster speaks the first words of the scroll in the fiend’s presence, the demon is immediately held in place (unless its innate magic resistance allows it to escape this effect). Even if the fiend’s magic resistance protects it, the words of the scroll cause considerable agony, and if the creature has the ability to escape it is only 10% likely to remain and try to stop the final reading (0% likelihood if it has no means of attacking the magic user, gaining possession of the scroll, or otherwise influencing events in its favour). After one full minute of reading the scroll (i.e., in the second round), the fiend loses 1 hp/ hit die from pain. In the third round, the fiend loses 50% of its remaining hit points from the agony caused by the words of the scroll. After the third round of reading, the fiend is banished to its home plane, where it writhes in agony for a period of years equal to the caster’s level.\n\nObviously, any fiend caught with this ritual will seek to negotiate its way out; the GM will determine probabilities based on the fiend’s goals and personality, but the base likelihood will be roughly 25% per round that the fiend will agree to perform a task for the caster in exchange for nothing more than the cessation of the ritual.'],

During the initial transformation, the creature must make a special system shock roll with a flat 82% chance of success, with a +1 for every point of constitution the creature possesses (100% chance at Con 18). Failing this roll means that the creature dies. The statue does radiate magic slightly and can be detected in this manner as well as with other similar divination spells or items.

Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be travelled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\n\nSimilar Area: The caster winds up in an area that is visually or thematically (depending on how the caster identified it while casting) similar to the target area. It is possible (25% chance) that this result will indicate that the correct location has been reached but that the caster and party will arrive too high, falling 1d% ft unless there is means to arrest the fall.

As the spell is cast, the character’s material body enters a trance-like state of suspended animation while his or her consciousness enters the astral plane. The astral plane is a nexus with other planes of existence beyond, and the illusionist may choose to enter these other planes of existence. If a character does transcend from the astral into another plane, he or she becomes a physical manifestation in that existence, forming a duplicate body identical to the one left in stasis back in the material plane. It is possible to travel astrally to other locations in the material plane, but a new body cannot be formed in a plane where the character already has a physical manifestation. While travelling in the astral plane, and after a new physical manifestation has formed on a plane beyond the astral, the character remains connected to his or her original body by a “silver cord,” an invisible, mystical link. If the silver cord is broken or severed (some threats in the astral plane can cause this to happen), the character dies, both on the material plane and in astral form.\n\nMost magic items lose some or all of their power on the astral plane.

A demon wielding a sword can attack and do damage, and the appearance of a pit full of spikes can be fatal even though it is not real.

Various methods may be used by the GM to determine if an NPC or monster believes the effect of a phantasmal force, common sense being the first thing to consider.
