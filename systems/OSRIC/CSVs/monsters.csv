Fewer than 50 of these creatures are believed to exist and the secret of their creation process died with the creators—when the spectral trolls rose up in revolt and fed upon their life energy. Spectral trolls are invisible. Anyone able to see invisible will see a monster that appears very much like a shorter-than-normal troll with somewhat indistinct features and glowing amber eyes.\nSpectral trolls have 3 attacks which cause special damage (detailed below) and can target up to 3 different opponents if they choose. Spectral trolls regenerate 3 hit points per round and can rebond severed limbs and, as with their troll brethren, severed limbs will continue to attack independently. These creatures are impervious to cold and cold based attacks while fi re or fi re based attacks cause damage which does not regenerate. Spectral trolls can only be hit by magical weapons.\nSpecial Damage: The spectral troll has two claw attacks that subtract 1d3 points of damage on a successful hit from both the victim’s hp and his or her strength ability score. For example: a 17 strength fi ghter struck for 2 hit points of damage will immediately be reduced to a strength of 15. Strength is recovered at a rate of 1 point for every 2d4 turns. If a victim’s strength is reduced to zero he or she dies; if strength is reduced to 1 or 2 hit points the victim will fall comatose to the ground and will not recover consciousness until enough strength is recovered to raise score to 3 or higher.\nIn addition to the special claw attacks, the spectral troll also has a fanged biting attack. The bite attack of one of these invisible monsters infl icts 1d6 points of damage but the troll adds its own hit  point value as bonus damage to the attack. Example: a spectral troll with 38 hit points bites a cleric for 4 points of damage. Total damage dealt to the unfortunate cleric would 4 + 38 = 42.\nSpectral trolls have an acute sense of smell and superior infravision with a 120 ft range. Like all trolls, the spectral troll is strong, fearless, and attacks relentlessly until it kills its opponent or is itself slain.'

They are also used as tools by demon lords, who might communicate through them. Quasits are generally tasked with helping their masters to spread evil and chaos. In particular, they are often used to pervert lawful evil souls to chaos, which earns them rewards on their home plane of the Abyss. Ultimately, when its master dies, the quasit is charged with bringing the soul back to the Abyss. If the quasit has served well, it may be rewarded by being changed into a class A or class B demon.

They appear as strangely beautiful humanoids with lightly scaled greenish skin and webbed hands and feet.

They also appear to be able to communicate, at least on a rudimentary level, with freshwater fish of all types.<br /><br />Being fey, nixies take great delight in enslaving humans. If a human or demi-human approaches within 30 ft of a group of nixies they will attempt to charm him or her with a special group <i>charm</i> spell. This charm requires a minimum of 10 nixies to join hands and chant, and any person hearing this fey chanting must save vs spells at -2 or enter the water to serve the nixies as slave and paramour for a period of a year and a day. It should be noted a side effect of this variant charm grants the ability to breathe water for the duration of the spell. There is a brief opportunity to break the charm; if a <i>dispel magic</i> is cast upon the enthralled person before they enter the water there is a 75% the spell will be broken but once the victim has begun breathing water the chances of breaking the charm drop to only 10%.<br /><br />Nixies are weak in combat but make up for this weakness by attacking en masse and overwhelming their enemies. They favour fighting with long daggers and long darts which, due to the nixies short stature, function as spears in their hands. Nixies will melee with these spears underwater and above water they will hurl them like missiles then melee with their daggers.<br /><br />Nixies fear bright light and fire, their aquatic nature makes these things foreign to them and a strong presentation of either will drive them away. A strong light source presented underwater will be obscured by schools of nixie summoned fish surrounding the spell effect.

Nymphs typically speak common in addition to their own enchanting language and reputedly have voices like honeyed nectar.<br /><br />If attacked, nymphs will almost always attempt to flee, often by means of <i>dimension door</i>, which they are able to use once every day. Nymphs are also able to employ magic as though they were 7th level druids. Any character that chances to look upon a clothed nymph must make a saving throw vs spells or be permanently blinded; should a nymph be seen unclothed, then the consequence of a failed saving throw is death. Should a Nymph deign to bestow a kiss upon a male, he will forget his troubles and pain for the remainder of the day.<br /><br />Nymphs abhor evil and will occasionally aid someone in distress. Moreover, there is a small chance that a nymph will be favourably inclined towards a good aligned character who actively seeks her out, as long as he does not look upon her first; in the case of good- aligned human males with exceptional charisma, the chance of her favour is very high, but a saving throw is still required if he should happen to look upon her.<br /><br />A lock of nymph’s hair woven into a cloak or other item of clothing will magically increase the charisma of those who wear it by one point. Alternatively, the lock of hair may be used to create a powerful <i>potion of sleep</i>.

This sundering of their metaphysical essence creates a foul thing, roaming dark and desolate places, existing in both the æthereal plane and the prime material, seeking to slake a thirst that can never be sated. This exigent need for living essences is what drives these spirits into contact with mortals.<br /><br />Merely beholding the awfulness of the ghost requires a saving throw vs magic. Failure causes the viewer to flee in panic (for 2d8 turns) and initiates a weaker form of the ghost’s <i>wither</i> attack—which ages the victim 3d6 years as the ghost feasts on the life of the victim.<br /><br />Clerics level 7 or greater can ignore this effect, as they have a better understanding of how to ward off such metaphysical forces, while other intelligences with 9 or more hit dice or levels gain a +3 to their saves.<br /><br />Until the ghost manifests itself physically, it is immune to all attacks, spell or no, unless the attacker has a method to become æthereal. Even if the spellcaster is in this state, ghosts are still immune to many forms of spells, though no sage has recorded what those magics might be. Magical weapons used in an æthereal state against a ghost typically have to strike against AC 7 or 8.<br /><br />As if these terrible powers were not enough, any creature within 180 ft is threatened by the being’s <i>magic jar</i> ability, as per the spell. If this fails, then the ghost will manifest itself, taking on an ectoplasmic quality. Specially forged “pure” metals, especially silver, can cause half-damage to a ghost while it is manifested in this fashion, and magic weapons can affect it normally—in either case the attacker must hit AC 0. Spells still cannot affect it in this state unless the caster is æthereal. The manifest state allows the ghost to strike victims physically, with the full power of their <i>withering</i> attack—causing the victim to age 7d6 years per successful attack, no save possible. Victims who exceed their allotted lifespan are forever dead, with only a wish capable of reversing this end.'

Unholy magics and an unwavering devotion are not the only things keeping them on the prime material plane. Their souls are already traded to dark gods, but a spark of their essence remains that must be encased in a talisman of sorts. This trinket is a requirement of their Unlife, but no scholar knows how or why this is.<br /><br />The lair of a lich will often be a complex underworld maze or a wickedly diseased stretch of thick wilderness, at whose black heart resides a tower riddled with magic traps and deadly guardians. Liches do not suffer the fools who would tread upon their mysteries.<br /><br />Each lich will be able to cast an impressive battery of spells, and those with magic user abilities will have multiple copies of powerful spell tomes. Their magical ability, at a minimum, must be 18th, as only those mortals have travelled so far down the path of magic have even a hope of mastering the rituals of Lichdom. The mere touch of a lich will inflict 2 dice of cold damage upon the victim, and they must save vs paralysation or be held frozen to the spot for 3d8 turns. Anything below 6th level beholding a lich (even in a reflection or a <i>projected image</i>) must save vs magic or never return to the area again.<br /><br />Often dressed in rich decaying rags that were exquisite in life, liches are now horrors to behold. They are cadaverous in appearance, with unholy pinpoints of green light emanating from the otherwise empty pits that are the eye-sockets of its fleshless skull. Diseased and leprous tatters of meat cling feebly to ancient bones, reeking with the rot of the grave.<br /><br />Liches are believed to feast on Soul Worms.'

Normally found in tombs or other burial places, they hate life and attempt to destroy any living creature they encounter.<br /><br />The touch of a mummy causes a wasting and rotting disease which will cause death within 1d6 months. For each month of affliction, the victim permanently loses 2 points of charisma, and while diseased no <i>cure wound</i> spells will have any effect and any wounds will naturally heal at a 10% rate. The mummy rot can only be cured by a <i>cure disease</i> spell.<br /><br />All creatures within 60 ft of a mummy, upon sight, will suffer the effects of fear and revulsion unless a successful saving throw vs magic is made. If the save fails, the victim will be paralysed for 1d4 rounds. Groups of creatures gain a bonus of +1 for their save at a ratio of six creatures for each mummy (for example: 12 creatures in sight of 1 mummy gain a +2 to save; 12 creatures in sight of 2 mummies gain a +1, and 12 creatures within sight of 3 or more mummies gain no bonus). If humans confront a mummy, then each human will gain a +2 to his or her save.<br /><br />A mummy cannot be harmed by normal weapons, and magical weapons do only half damage (drop all fractions). A mummy is immune to <i>sleep</i>, <i>hold</i> spells, <i>charm</i> spells, and cold based attacks. Poison and paralysis have no effect on the creature. A <i>raise dead</i> spell will transform the monster into a 7th-level fighter unless the mummy makes a successful save vs magic (unlisted categories).<br /><br />A mummy is susceptible to fire as follows: a hit from a torch will deal 1d3 hp damage, a flask of burning oil causes 1d8 hp on the first round and 2d8 hp on the second round, and magical fires deal +1 for each die of damage. Holy water inflicts 2d4 hp per vial that hits.<br /><br />Any character killed by a mummy cannot be raised due to the amount of damage caused by the rotting waste unless a <i>cure disease</i> and <i>raise dead</i> are both cast on the victim within one hour of death.'

So far as is known, all poltergeists were formerly human or at least half-human. They are only rarely encountered as a wandering monster but in such a case can be treated as a type 1 undead for purposes of turning or disrupting. More often, however, the poltergeist is in the area where it met its untimely end. The poltergeist’s bond to this area is strong and turning is much more difficult, treat the poltergeist as a turning a type 3 undead in this case.<br /><br />In combat, the poltergeist can only be struck by magical or silver weapons and its invisibility will cause all attacks against it to be made at -4 (unless the attacker can <i>see invisible</i>). It will not cross over sprinkled holy water, though after the holy water dries it is no longer effective at warding them. Holy water does not cause actual harm to poltergeists. A cleric can strongly present a holy symbol to keep them at bay as well, but again this does not harm the creature.<br /><br />Poltergeists cannot physically attack. Instead they hurl objects with a telekinetic power at their opponents, attacking as a 5 HD monster. These objects must be light enough to be thrown by a standard human; books, torches, lamps, chairs and so on. A poltergeist’s lair will include many such objects. Anyone struck takes no damage, but he or she must save vs spells or flee at top movement speed for 2d12 rounds. A fleeing victim has a 50% for dropping whatever is held in his or her hands, but not necessarily right away. When a PC succumbs to the poltergeist’s fear effect, determine how many rounds he or she will flee, then roll the dice again to determine on which round hand held items will be dropped. Once an opponent has made his or her saving throw, that individual will be immune to further fear for that encounter only and from that poltergeist only if more than 1 are present.'

Their ties to the negative material plane cause living things they hit in melee to lose a point of Str, Dex or Con. The attribute drained is random; but once determined further attacks by the same pack of shadows drain the same attribute until that statistic reaches zero—at which point the victim becomes a shadow under the control of the creature that drained the last point. Points drained, but not brought to nil, will return to the victim after about an hour, but some Shadow attacks take longer to recover from.<br /><br />Due to their partial immaterialness, they can only be hit by magic weapons or certain spells. Cold attacks are useless, as are sleep, hold, and spells that affect the mind. They are nearly undetectable in their normal conditions, requiring an 18 or better on a d20 to be aware of them before they attack. Infravision does not detect them as they do not radiate heat, but magical light is sufficient to reveal these horrors for what they are.<br /><br />Some shadows attack victims in their sleep, giving them night-mares from which they never wake, as their physical forms are drained of life by the shadows’ horrid ties to worlds beyond mundane reckoning.'

They are completely mindless, only obeying the simple commands of their animator, which is often limited by the spell itself to a score of words. Some sages speak, though, of the mere proximity to great Evil can animate the dead, resulting in armies of these horrors springing to Unlife in forgotten catacombs and foul dungeons. Though given no commands, they seek out the living and attempt to force them into the ranks of the dead.<br /><br />No matter how a skeleton attacks, whether rusty blade, a stone, or its own former femur, it always deals 1d6 damage. Cold and spells that attack the mind have no affect on skeletons. They take less damage from edged and cutting weapons, typically reducing the damage by half. Most piercing weapons, like arrows and spears, do but 1 or 2 points maximum per attack. Holy water inflicts 2d4 hp per vial that strikes.'

Thus, when their barely-material forms come in contact with the living, they drain two levels of experience from the victim. Those reduced below zero energy levels become half-strength spectres under control of the one that stole their life-force. The living in turn can only affect spectres with magic weapons (of at least +1 value) or spells. Elemental spells and enchantments that affect the mind have no power over spectres. Liquids blessed by the gods still inflict damage upon them. If a cleric (good or evil) attempts to restore a spectre back to life via a spell or ritual, the spectre must make a saving throw or its existence is removed from the plane that fuels its Unlife and it becomes naught in the world of living.<br /><br />Some sages speculate that spectres have no power in sunlight, but no one has ever proved this theory.'

Being similar to other undead, they dwell simultaneously in the negative material and material planes. They share other undead’s immunity to <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, and <i>sleep</i> spells. Electricity and cold does only half damage, they are unaffected by normal weapons, and they regenerate 3 hit points per round. Vampires must take refuge in a coffin or other hideaway during daylight, and must slumber on soil from their own grave once in a while to maintain their powers.<br /><br />Vampires are immensely strong (18.76), and deal great blows that inflict 1d6+4 hit points of damage. These blows further reduce the victim’s life energy by two levels, which consequently reduces all other traits linked to a loss in levels (attack ability, hit dice, etc.).<br /><br />Vampires may take gaseous form at will, and will be forced into this form if their hit points reach zero. They then attempt to reach their coffin to reform their bodies. If they do not reach the coffin within 12 turns and rest for 8 hours, they are unable to reform.<br /><br />Further, vampires may <i>shape change</i> into a large bat at will, which grants them flying movement. They can summon 1d10×10 bats or rats when underground or 3d6 wolves when above. These creatures will arrive in 2d6 rounds. In addition, a vampire has a <i>charm</i> gaze (as the <i>charm person</i> spell), with a saving throw penalty of -2.<br /><br />Although these items do not actually cause harm or completely repel these creatures, vampires will draw back from a lawful good holy symbol, a mirror, or garlic if they are presented with confidence. Garlic causes a vampire to cringe for 1d4 rounds, and a holy symbol or mirror will cause a vampire to take a position in which the item does not impede his or her progress or attack. A lawful good holy symbol will affect a vampire no matter what its ethos was in life. Once a person becomes a vampire, he or she is a chaotic evil undead creature. Holy water will inflict 1d6+1 points of damage per full vial which strikes.<br /><br />There are few means by which a vampire may be destroyed. They take great damage from immersion in running water, and will be killed in 3 rounds (each round reduces 1/3 of the creature’s hit points). If caught in sunlight a vampire becomes powerless and will die in 1 turn. Finally, a stake through the heart, coupled with decapitation, will destroy a vampire if holy sacraments (such as wafers) are placed in the mouth after the head is removed. If a vampire is staked he or she will appear to die, but unless also decapitated the vampire will revive when the stake is removed.<br /><br />Vampires create others of their kind by draining humans or humanoids of all life energy. The victim must be buried. After 1 day he or she will arise as a vampire. The victim will retain class abilities he or she had in life but will become a chaotic evil undead being. The new vampire is a slave to the vampire that created him or her, but becomes free willed if the master is killed.<br /><br />There is a variant type of vampire from the east, which cannot assume <i>gaseous form</i> at will (but will if reduced to zero hit points), nor does it have a <i>charm</i> gaze. However, it is <i>invisible</i> and foes that cannot detect invisibility suffer –4 to strike these vampires in combat.'

Their undead power is linked to the negative material plane, and thus they permanently drain a level of experience from victims when they score a hit in combat. Although they are not damaged by sunlight, they loathe the rays of the sun and do not emerge by choice from their barrows and lairs during daylight. Wights are immune to <i>sleep</i>, <i>hold</i>, cold, and enchantment spells. They take 2d4 points of damage from holy water (per vial), and are destroyed by the casting of a <i>raise dead</i> spell.

This unholy process involves draining all the life force from the unfortunate victim, who can be a human, demi-human, or humanoid. These creatures are then completely subservient to their master, who can issue commands to them to guard, attack, or patrol an area, or other similar orders. Juju zombies are like regular zombies but are improved in virtually every way. This type of zombie moves more quickly, has an improved AC, climbs with the skill of an 8th level thief, attack as 6 HD monsters, use missile weapons such as crossbows or pulled bows, and can even use hurled weapons such as spears or javelins.<br /><br />In combat, juju zombies attack with their clawed hands but they can be programmed to use weapons by their master. Due to their strong connection to the Negative Material Plane, juju zombies can only be hit by magic weapons. Magic piercing or blunt weapons do half damage owing to the undead nature of the monsters, magic slashing weapons do full damage.<br /><br />Juju zombies are immune to all mind altering magic including, but not limited to: <i>illusion</i>, <i>charm</i>, <i>hold monster</i>, death, cold, and <i>sleep</i>. These monsters are also immune to poison and electrical damage, while fire or fire based magic does only half damage. Acid and holy water attacks do full damage. Juju zombies can be turned, but are more resistant to a cleric’s divine powers than regular zombies, hence harder to turn.<br /><br />The appearance of a juju zombie is much the same as a regular zombie but their leathery, greyish flesh is less decayed than the standard variety. The hatred for life of these obscene creations causes their eyes to burn with a hellish red glow.'

Weed eels have a single biting attack which injects a powerful poison into the wound: the victim must save or die. A weed eel lair consists of many small tunnels of about 6 inches diameter which eventually join into a series of 6 ft tunnels, which in turn lead to a large cave which is the actual lair. The cave is usually about 600 sq ft and the eels pave the bottom of it with any suitable material they find: small stones, gems, coins, and similar sized shiny objects. Any attempt by anyone or anything other than a weed eel to enter any hole leading to the lair will provoke an immediate attack by every eel in the colony.'
