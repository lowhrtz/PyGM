Fewer than 50 of these creatures are believed to exist and the secret of their creation process died with the creators—when the spectral trolls rose up in revolt and fed upon their life energy. Spectral trolls are invisible. Anyone able to see invisible will see a monster that appears very much like a shorter-than-normal troll with somewhat indistinct features and glowing amber eyes.\nSpectral trolls have 3 attacks which cause special damage (detailed below) and can target up to 3 different opponents if they choose. Spectral trolls regenerate 3 hit points per round and can rebond severed limbs and, as with their troll brethren, severed limbs will continue to attack independently. These creatures are impervious to cold and cold based attacks while fi re or fi re based attacks cause damage which does not regenerate. Spectral trolls can only be hit by magical weapons.\nSpecial Damage: The spectral troll has two claw attacks that subtract 1d3 points of damage on a successful hit from both the victim’s hp and his or her strength ability score. For example: a 17 strength fi ghter struck for 2 hit points of damage will immediately be reduced to a strength of 15. Strength is recovered at a rate of 1 point for every 2d4 turns. If a victim’s strength is reduced to zero he or she dies; if strength is reduced to 1 or 2 hit points the victim will fall comatose to the ground and will not recover consciousness until enough strength is recovered to raise score to 3 or higher.\nIn addition to the special claw attacks, the spectral troll also has a fanged biting attack. The bite attack of one of these invisible monsters infl icts 1d6 points of damage but the troll adds its own hit  point value as bonus damage to the attack. Example: a spectral troll with 38 hit points bites a cleric for 4 points of damage. Total damage dealt to the unfortunate cleric would 4 + 38 = 42.\nSpectral trolls have an acute sense of smell and superior infravision with a 120 ft range. Like all trolls, the spectral troll is strong, fearless, and attacks relentlessly until it kills its opponent or is itself slain.'

They are also used as tools by demon lords, who might communicate through them. Quasits are generally tasked with helping their masters to spread evil and chaos. In particular, they are often used to pervert lawful evil souls to chaos, which earns them rewards on their home plane of the Abyss. Ultimately, when its master dies, the quasit is charged with bringing the soul back to the Abyss. If the quasit has served well, it may be rewarded by being changed into a class A or class B demon.

They appear as strangely beautiful humanoids with lightly scaled greenish skin and webbed hands and feet.

They also appear to be able to communicate, at least on a rudimentary level, with freshwater fish of all types.<br /><br />Being fey, nixies take great delight in enslaving humans. If a human or demi-human approaches within 30 ft of a group of nixies they will attempt to charm him or her with a special group <i>charm</i> spell. This charm requires a minimum of 10 nixies to join hands and chant, and any person hearing this fey chanting must save vs spells at -2 or enter the water to serve the nixies as slave and paramour for a period of a year and a day. It should be noted a side effect of this variant charm grants the ability to breathe water for the duration of the spell. There is a brief opportunity to break the charm; if a <i>dispel magic</i> is cast upon the enthralled person before they enter the water there is a 75% the spell will be broken but once the victim has begun breathing water the chances of breaking the charm drop to only 10%.<br /><br />Nixies are weak in combat but make up for this weakness by attacking en masse and overwhelming their enemies. They favour fighting with long daggers and long darts which, due to the nixies short stature, function as spears in their hands. Nixies will melee with these spears underwater and above water they will hurl them like missiles then melee with their daggers.<br /><br />Nixies fear bright light and fire, their aquatic nature makes these things foreign to them and a strong presentation of either will drive them away. A strong light source presented underwater will be obscured by schools of nixie summoned fish surrounding the spell effect.

Nymphs typically speak common in addition to their own enchanting language and reputedly have voices like honeyed nectar.<br /><br />If attacked, nymphs will almost always attempt to flee, often by means of <i>dimension door</i>, which they are able to use once every day. Nymphs are also able to employ magic as though they were 7th level druids. Any character that chances to look upon a clothed nymph must make a saving throw vs spells or be permanently blinded; should a nymph be seen unclothed, then the consequence of a failed saving throw is death. Should a Nymph deign to bestow a kiss upon a male, he will forget his troubles and pain for the remainder of the day.<br /><br />Nymphs abhor evil and will occasionally aid someone in distress. Moreover, there is a small chance that a nymph will be favourably inclined towards a good aligned character who actively seeks her out, as long as he does not look upon her first; in the case of good- aligned human males with exceptional charisma, the chance of her favour is very high, but a saving throw is still required if he should happen to look upon her.<br /><br />A lock of nymph’s hair woven into a cloak or other item of clothing will magically increase the charisma of those who wear it by one point. Alternatively, the lock of hair may be used to create a powerful <i>potion of sleep</i>.

This sundering of their metaphysical essence creates a foul thing, roaming dark and desolate places, existing in both the æthereal plane and the prime material, seeking to slake a thirst that can never be sated. This exigent need for living essences is what drives these spirits into contact with mortals.<br /><br />Merely beholding the awfulness of the ghost requires a saving throw vs magic. Failure causes the viewer to flee in panic (for 2d8 turns) and initiates a weaker form of the ghost’s <i>wither</i> attack—which ages the victim 3d6 years as the ghost feasts on the life of the victim.<br /><br />Clerics level 7 or greater can ignore this effect, as they have a better understanding of how to ward off such metaphysical forces, while other intelligences with 9 or more hit dice or levels gain a +3 to their saves.<br /><br />Until the ghost manifests itself physically, it is immune to all attacks, spell or no, unless the attacker has a method to become æthereal. Even if the spellcaster is in this state, ghosts are still immune to many forms of spells, though no sage has recorded what those magics might be. Magical weapons used in an æthereal state against a ghost typically have to strike against AC 7 or 8.<br /><br />As if these terrible powers were not enough, any creature within 180 ft is threatened by the being’s <i>magic jar</i> ability, as per the spell. If this fails, then the ghost will manifest itself, taking on an ectoplasmic quality. Specially forged “pure” metals, especially silver, can cause half-damage to a ghost while it is manifested in this fashion, and magic weapons can affect it normally—in either case the attacker must hit AC 0. Spells still cannot affect it in this state unless the caster is æthereal. The manifest state allows the ghost to strike victims physically, with the full power of their <i>withering</i> attack—causing the victim to age 7d6 years per successful attack, no save possible. Victims who exceed their allotted lifespan are forever dead, with only a wish capable of reversing this end.'

Unholy magics and an unwavering devotion are not the only things keeping them on the prime material plane. Their souls are already traded to dark gods, but a spark of their essence remains that must be encased in a talisman of sorts. This trinket is a requirement of their Unlife, but no scholar knows how or why this is.<br /><br />The lair of a lich will often be a complex underworld maze or a wickedly diseased stretch of thick wilderness, at whose black heart resides a tower riddled with magic traps and deadly guardians. Liches do not suffer the fools who would tread upon their mysteries.<br /><br />Each lich will be able to cast an impressive battery of spells, and those with magic user abilities will have multiple copies of powerful spell tomes. Their magical ability, at a minimum, must be 18th, as only those mortals have travelled so far down the path of magic have even a hope of mastering the rituals of Lichdom. The mere touch of a lich will inflict 2 dice of cold damage upon the victim, and they must save vs paralysation or be held frozen to the spot for 3d8 turns. Anything below 6th level beholding a lich (even in a reflection or a <i>projected image</i>) must save vs magic or never return to the area again.<br /><br />Often dressed in rich decaying rags that were exquisite in life, liches are now horrors to behold. They are cadaverous in appearance, with unholy pinpoints of green light emanating from the otherwise empty pits that are the eye-sockets of its fleshless skull. Diseased and leprous tatters of meat cling feebly to ancient bones, reeking with the rot of the grave.<br /><br />Liches are believed to feast on Soul Worms.'

Normally found in tombs or other burial places, they hate life and attempt to destroy any living creature they encounter.<br /><br />The touch of a mummy causes a wasting and rotting disease which will cause death within 1d6 months. For each month of affliction, the victim permanently loses 2 points of charisma, and while diseased no <i>cure wound</i> spells will have any effect and any wounds will naturally heal at a 10% rate. The mummy rot can only be cured by a <i>cure disease</i> spell.<br /><br />All creatures within 60 ft of a mummy, upon sight, will suffer the effects of fear and revulsion unless a successful saving throw vs magic is made. If the save fails, the victim will be paralysed for 1d4 rounds. Groups of creatures gain a bonus of +1 for their save at a ratio of six creatures for each mummy (for example: 12 creatures in sight of 1 mummy gain a +2 to save; 12 creatures in sight of 2 mummies gain a +1, and 12 creatures within sight of 3 or more mummies gain no bonus). If humans confront a mummy, then each human will gain a +2 to his or her save.<br /><br />A mummy cannot be harmed by normal weapons, and magical weapons do only half damage (drop all fractions). A mummy is immune to <i>sleep</i>, <i>hold</i> spells, <i>charm</i> spells, and cold based attacks. Poison and paralysis have no effect on the creature. A <i>raise dead</i> spell will transform the monster into a 7th-level fighter unless the mummy makes a successful save vs magic (unlisted categories).<br /><br />A mummy is susceptible to fire as follows: a hit from a torch will deal 1d3 hp damage, a flask of burning oil causes 1d8 hp on the first round and 2d8 hp on the second round, and magical fires deal +1 for each die of damage. Holy water inflicts 2d4 hp per vial that hits.<br /><br />Any character killed by a mummy cannot be raised due to the amount of damage caused by the rotting waste unless a <i>cure disease</i> and <i>raise dead</i> are both cast on the victim within one hour of death.'

So far as is known, all poltergeists were formerly human or at least half-human. They are only rarely encountered as a wandering monster but in such a case can be treated as a type 1 undead for purposes of turning or disrupting. More often, however, the poltergeist is in the area where it met its untimely end. The poltergeist’s bond to this area is strong and turning is much more difficult, treat the poltergeist as a turning a type 3 undead in this case.<br /><br />In combat, the poltergeist can only be struck by magical or silver weapons and its invisibility will cause all attacks against it to be made at -4 (unless the attacker can <i>see invisible</i>). It will not cross over sprinkled holy water, though after the holy water dries it is no longer effective at warding them. Holy water does not cause actual harm to poltergeists. A cleric can strongly present a holy symbol to keep them at bay as well, but again this does not harm the creature.<br /><br />Poltergeists cannot physically attack. Instead they hurl objects with a telekinetic power at their opponents, attacking as a 5 HD monster. These objects must be light enough to be thrown by a standard human; books, torches, lamps, chairs and so on. A poltergeist’s lair will include many such objects. Anyone struck takes no damage, but he or she must save vs spells or flee at top movement speed for 2d12 rounds. A fleeing victim has a 50% for dropping whatever is held in his or her hands, but not necessarily right away. When a PC succumbs to the poltergeist’s fear effect, determine how many rounds he or she will flee, then roll the dice again to determine on which round hand held items will be dropped. Once an opponent has made his or her saving throw, that individual will be immune to further fear for that encounter only and from that poltergeist only if more than 1 are present.'

Their ties to the negative material plane cause living things they hit in melee to lose a point of Str, Dex or Con. The attribute drained is random; but once determined further attacks by the same pack of shadows drain the same attribute until that statistic reaches zero—at which point the victim becomes a shadow under the control of the creature that drained the last point. Points drained, but not brought to nil, will return to the victim after about an hour, but some Shadow attacks take longer to recover from.<br /><br />Due to their partial immaterialness, they can only be hit by magic weapons or certain spells. Cold attacks are useless, as are sleep, hold, and spells that affect the mind. They are nearly undetectable in their normal conditions, requiring an 18 or better on a d20 to be aware of them before they attack. Infravision does not detect them as they do not radiate heat, but magical light is sufficient to reveal these horrors for what they are.<br /><br />Some shadows attack victims in their sleep, giving them night-mares from which they never wake, as their physical forms are drained of life by the shadows’ horrid ties to worlds beyond mundane reckoning.'

They are completely mindless, only obeying the simple commands of their animator, which is often limited by the spell itself to a score of words. Some sages speak, though, of the mere proximity to great Evil can animate the dead, resulting in armies of these horrors springing to Unlife in forgotten catacombs and foul dungeons. Though given no commands, they seek out the living and attempt to force them into the ranks of the dead.<br /><br />No matter how a skeleton attacks, whether rusty blade, a stone, or its own former femur, it always deals 1d6 damage. Cold and spells that attack the mind have no affect on skeletons. They take less damage from edged and cutting weapons, typically reducing the damage by half. Most piercing weapons, like arrows and spears, do but 1 or 2 points maximum per attack. Holy water inflicts 2d4 hp per vial that strikes.'

Thus, when their barely-material forms come in contact with the living, they drain two levels of experience from the victim. Those reduced below zero energy levels become half-strength spectres under control of the one that stole their life-force. The living in turn can only affect spectres with magic weapons (of at least +1 value) or spells. Elemental spells and enchantments that affect the mind have no power over spectres. Liquids blessed by the gods still inflict damage upon them. If a cleric (good or evil) attempts to restore a spectre back to life via a spell or ritual, the spectre must make a saving throw or its existence is removed from the plane that fuels its Unlife and it becomes naught in the world of living.<br /><br />Some sages speculate that spectres have no power in sunlight, but no one has ever proved this theory.'

Being similar to other undead, they dwell simultaneously in the negative material and material planes. They share other undead’s immunity to <i>charm</i>, <i>hold</i>, and <i>sleep</i> spells. Electricity and cold does only half damage, they are unaffected by normal weapons, and they regenerate 3 hit points per round. Vampires must take refuge in a coffin or other hideaway during daylight, and must slumber on soil from their own grave once in a while to maintain their powers.<br /><br />Vampires are immensely strong (18.76), and deal great blows that inflict 1d6+4 hit points of damage. These blows further reduce the victim’s life energy by two levels, which consequently reduces all other traits linked to a loss in levels (attack ability, hit dice, etc.).<br /><br />Vampires may take gaseous form at will, and will be forced into this form if their hit points reach zero. They then attempt to reach their coffin to reform their bodies. If they do not reach the coffin within 12 turns and rest for 8 hours, they are unable to reform.<br /><br />Further, vampires may <i>shape change</i> into a large bat at will, which grants them flying movement. They can summon 1d10×10 bats or rats when underground or 3d6 wolves when above. These creatures will arrive in 2d6 rounds. In addition, a vampire has a <i>charm</i> gaze (as the <i>charm person</i> spell), with a saving throw penalty of -2.<br /><br />Although these items do not actually cause harm or completely repel these creatures, vampires will draw back from a lawful good holy symbol, a mirror, or garlic if they are presented with confidence. Garlic causes a vampire to cringe for 1d4 rounds, and a holy symbol or mirror will cause a vampire to take a position in which the item does not impede his or her progress or attack. A lawful good holy symbol will affect a vampire no matter what its ethos was in life. Once a person becomes a vampire, he or she is a chaotic evil undead creature. Holy water will inflict 1d6+1 points of damage per full vial which strikes.<br /><br />There are few means by which a vampire may be destroyed. They take great damage from immersion in running water, and will be killed in 3 rounds (each round reduces 1/3 of the creature’s hit points). If caught in sunlight a vampire becomes powerless and will die in 1 turn. Finally, a stake through the heart, coupled with decapitation, will destroy a vampire if holy sacraments (such as wafers) are placed in the mouth after the head is removed. If a vampire is staked he or she will appear to die, but unless also decapitated the vampire will revive when the stake is removed.<br /><br />Vampires create others of their kind by draining humans or humanoids of all life energy. The victim must be buried. After 1 day he or she will arise as a vampire. The victim will retain class abilities he or she had in life but will become a chaotic evil undead being. The new vampire is a slave to the vampire that created him or her, but becomes free willed if the master is killed.<br /><br />There is a variant type of vampire from the east, which cannot assume <i>gaseous form</i> at will (but will if reduced to zero hit points), nor does it have a <i>charm</i> gaze. However, it is <i>invisible</i> and foes that cannot detect invisibility suffer –4 to strike these vampires in combat.'

Their undead power is linked to the negative material plane, and thus they permanently drain a level of experience from victims when they score a hit in combat. Although they are not damaged by sunlight, they loathe the rays of the sun and do not emerge by choice from their barrows and lairs during daylight. Wights are immune to <i>sleep</i>, <i>hold</i>, cold, and enchantment spells. They take 2d4 points of damage from holy water (per vial), and are destroyed by the casting of a <i>raise dead</i> spell.

This unholy process involves draining all the life force from the unfortunate victim, who can be a human, demi-human, or humanoid. These creatures are then completely subservient to their master, who can issue commands to them to guard, attack, or patrol an area, or other similar orders. Juju zombies are like regular zombies but are improved in virtually every way. This type of zombie moves more quickly, has an improved AC, climbs with the skill of an 8th level thief, attack as 6 HD monsters, use missile weapons such as crossbows or pulled bows, and can even use hurled weapons such as spears or javelins.<br /><br />In combat, juju zombies attack with their clawed hands but they can be programmed to use weapons by their master. Due to their strong connection to the Negative Material Plane, juju zombies can only be hit by magic weapons. Magic piercing or blunt weapons do half damage owing to the undead nature of the monsters, magic slashing weapons do full damage.<br /><br />Juju zombies are immune to all mind altering magic including, but not limited to: <i>illusion</i>, <i>charm</i>, <i>hold monster</i>, death, cold, and <i>sleep</i>. These monsters are also immune to poison and electrical damage, while fire or fire based magic does only half damage. Acid and holy water attacks do full damage. Juju zombies can be turned, but are more resistant to a cleric’s divine powers than regular zombies, hence harder to turn.<br /><br />The appearance of a juju zombie is much the same as a regular zombie but their leathery, greyish flesh is less decayed than the standard variety. The hatred for life of these obscene creations causes their eyes to burn with a hellish red glow.'

Upon reaching maturity each vine covers about 20 sq ft, has 2d6 blooms and 1d4 buds. Not only does the amber creeping vine not require sunlight to grow, it actually appears to thrive in the absence of light. Amber creepers are often found growing in the soil of caverns and dungeons or in the deep, dark hearts of ancient forests, climbing up the rock walls or clinging to tree trunks alike with ease. Indeed, the problem is not getting the vines to grow, it is controlling their spread. These plants can defend themselves and there are those who take advantage of these abilities by planting amber creeping vines near treasure troves.<br /><br />Amber creeping vines sustain themselves by feeding on living creatures unfortunate enough to approach too close. When a creature approaches within 10 ft of the vine its amber blossoms will start waving in a mesmerising pattern while puffing clouds of fragrant pollen into the target’s face. A successful hit indicates the victim has inhaled the pollen and he or she must save vs spells or become enthralled, walking forward into the mass of vines to be engulfed within its leafy, tentacle-like limbs. The individual will resist any attempts to restrain him or her from entering the vines.<br /><br />Once the victim is inside the plant, numerous root-like organs will intrude into his or her skull. The amber creeping vine will begin to consume the unfortunate victim’s brain at a rate of 1d4 intelligence points per round. Though the brain-consuming tendrils can be easily cut, so many attach to the victim so rapidly that the only way to stop the draining is to kill the creeper. The amber creeping vine has a bulbous root which lies 1 ft beneath the soil; stabbing through the root will kill the vine and halt the consumption of the victim’s brain tissue.<br /><br />If the intelligence drain is not halted before the victim’s intelligence ability score reaches zero, the victim dies and a bud flowers into bloom as a new bud sprouts from the vine. If the intelligence drain in any given round reduces the victim’s intelligence to exactly 1 or 2, the victim becomes an <i>amber zombie</i>. Intelligence loss in persons the creeper does not kill or transform into an amber zombie is temporary, requiring but a day of rest to regain a point of Int. Healing or other curative magic will restore full intelligence immediately, but a spell used thus will not heal hit points.<br /><br />Each amber creeping vine will have a number of zombies under its control equal to half the number of blooms, rounded down. Creepers do not value treasure but the belongings of those who have fallen victim to the plant’s pollen attack will be found in the soil under the plant. The vines are mobile enough to cover the evidence of the plant’s peculiar feeding habits.'

Succumbing to the amber creeping vine turns the skin amber and changes the eyes into glazed and lifeless parodies of their former appearance. The process of draining a victim’s intelligence also plants a vine seed into the skull. The resulting amber zombie is under control of the creating plant. The zombie will seek to bring new victims to the creeper’s hungry vines and if the creeper is attacked the amber zombie will defend it. Amber zombies use whatever weapons and armour the victim had at the time of his or her conversion, but the zombie fights as 2HD monster with no spell-using abilities or ability score bonuses.<br /><br />Despite their name, amber zombies are not undead and cannot be turned by a cleric. They are, however, immune to mind-influencing magic just as true zombies are. After 2 months of service the zombie wanders away from the parent plant to find a nice patch of soil in a likely spot, where it dies and a new amber creeping vine sprouts from the corpse.<br /><br />The only known way to cure an amber zombie is to kill the controlling creeper and cast both a <i>neutralise poison</i> and <i>heal</i> upon the zombie in rapid succession. The victim will be restored to his or her former self but will require a full week of rest for every 4 points (rounded up) of intelligence lost before being able to adventure again.'

Blink dogs are intelligent, as smart as the average human, and communicate amongst themselves via their high-pitched barks and low growls. Blink dogs are so-called because they can use a limited form of teleportation, called a <i>blink</i>, in a somewhat random fashion and at random intervals.<br /><br />In combat these amazing dogs use the ability to their advantage, blinking either behind or in flanking position of their opponents (negating dexterity bonuses to AC and shield bonus to AC, if applicable) 75% of the time. Coupled with their pack hunting tactics, blink dogs are fearsome opponents. In combat a blink dog will teleport on roll of 12 or greater on a 1d20. A second roll of the 1d20 reveals where the dog reappears: 01-15 = behind, 16-18 = non-shielded or right flank, 19 = shielded or left flank, 20 = front. If the pack takes more than 25% losses all will simultaneously blink out and not return. There is a longstanding hatred between blink dogs and coeurls and the two will attack each other on sight. Blinking is a natural ability for these animals and they will never materialise in an occupied space or within a solid object.<br /><br />If a blink dog lair is found there is a 60% chance of 3d4 pups. These younglings fight as 1 HD monsters and inflict 1d2 points of damage per attack, though they are far more likely to flee using their teleportation ability. A captured pup will make a loyal companion to a good aligned human, or, it can be sold for 1,500 gp (± 100-600 gp). A blink dog lair will contain treasure, see Treasure section.'

Like sharks, they are huge, vicious, and always hungry. They seem to be someone’s experiment gone wrong: a turtle crossed with an armadillo with just a touch of demon thrown in. Their favourite food is horse but they will eat just about anything that moves. The only kind of meat they don’t seem to like is dwarf or elf. They have been know to dig halflings right out of their holes.<br /><br />Being fearless, a bulette will attack anything that moves on sight. They have been known to attack a well-armed party to get at the horses. When they attack, they use their vicious bite and their two front claws. They are well armoured, but have two vulnerable spots: under their chests is a soft spot, only AC 6; and a bulette’s eyes are relatively unprotected, with an AC of 4. When cornered or seriously wounded, a bulette will attempt to leap 8 ft vertically and land directly on top of their victim, clawing with all four feet.<br /><br />Because they are artificially-created animals no one is sure how bulettes reproduce. It seems that a pair will share a territory, but no lair has ever been found. Their plates are highly prized by armourers. They can be easily fashioned into +1 or +2 shields.'

In their dormant state they are almost indistinguishable from a normal statue. The only indication of their true nature is a faint outline of sword held in one hand. They are created as guardians and will animate only when triggered by a certain event. Their trigger must be something simple like someone entering a room, lifting a chest, or opening a door. Once animated they will do their utmost to prevent the trigger from continuing. When their task is complete they will return to their previous place and form.<br /><br />The caryatid column’s main purpose is not combat, but if pressed they will use their swords and attack. They attack as 5HD monsters. Normal weapons do half damage and magical weapons score full damage, but without their additional magical effects. Additionally any weapon that hits a caryatid column has a 25% chance of breaking. For each plus that the weapon has reduces the chance of breaking by 5%; consider any magical weapons without any pluses as a +1.'

Using their claws they can scale vertical walls with only a 5% chance of slipping. Being feline, they retract their claws to move silently (75%). Because of their soft coat, they are able to hide in shadows 75% of the time. They also possess keen senses and can only be surprised 10% of the time.<br /><br />When they pounce on their victims they make their distinctive screech, doing 1d8 damage to all within hearing range (60ft).

Dark creepers detest sunlight and avoid any light as best they can, dwelling alone in dungeons or profane villages even deeper underground, composed of clans of 75-100 individuals. 25% of the population of a dark creeper village will be female. These villages are always governed by a dark stalker (q.v.).<br /><br />Solitary dark creepers tend to carry their treasure with them, concealed within the many loose folds of their dark clothing. There is a 20% chance a dark creeper will carry a magic dagger, 15% chance of a magic ring, and 10% chance of either 1d4 gems of random value or 1d3 items of random jewellery. Lair treasure probabilities for a lone dark creeper are 50% for a magic dagger, 10% for a magic ring, 30% for gems or jewellery. To generate treasure for a dark creeper village, multiply individual treasure chances by the number of males, adding 5d20 pp and 5d12 gp.<br /><br />Dark creepers have all the skills of a 4th level thief along with the following abilities: <i>Detect magic</i> and create <i>darkness</i> for 1 hour in a 50 ft radius from target thrice per day. The creepers’ general plan of attack is to use their darkness power to extinguish a party’s light sources, then sneak in and destroy all lanterns, torches, oil flasks, and tinderboxes. Any magical sources of light gain a saving throw vs magical cold to negate the affects of darkness upon that item only, if it fails the save it will function normally after 1 hour. After it accomplishes this task, the dark creeper will use its <i>detect magic</i> to find and steal any small magic items it can detect. Though the dark creeper will not fight to the death to steal the party’s magic items, it craves them and will take foolhardy chances if it feels it has even a small chance of success. A creeper’s <i>darkness</i> power will stop infravision, but it will generally only use it on a party’s sources of artificial light. A party travelling in the dark using infravision will not likely be blacked out by the creeper’s darkness.<br /><br />In combat a creeper is AC 0 in darkness, and if it has a magic dagger or magic ring as part of its treasure hoard it will use them. A dark creeper’s darkness power can be negated by spells that create light, and in such a case the creeper is only AC 8. When a creeper dies it body magically immolates in a fiercely hot blaze of disgusting purple and green flames. Metal items, including magical items of metal, carried as part of the creeper’s treasure hoard have an 80% of surviving this magical fire undamaged.

In an area settled by at least 25 solitary dark creepers there is a 90% chance there will be a dark creeper in the area, increased by 2% for every 5 additional creepers. A dark stalker is rarely encountered away from his or her clan, but if such an encounter occurs the stalker is probably on some mysterious personal mission and will not engage PCs unless forced to do so.<br /><br />In combat dark stalkers fight with abilities identical to dark creepers except they favour short swords over daggers and have an additional spell-like ability; <i>wall of fog</i> twice per day as per the spell.

Any doppelgänger’s attempt at physical disguise is only faulty 10% of the time, and its knowledge of the victim is facilitated by the doppelgänger’s innate ESP ability.

If a dracolisk speaks a language at all, it is usually Draconic, though it may be that some can understand other languages.<br /><br />Although capable of flight, dracolisks are limited to only short durations, ten or twenty minutes at the most, before they have to rest, so they principally use this form of movement to swoop down upon or escape from foes. In physical combat, dracolisks bite for 3d4 damage and strike for 1d6 damage with their two forelimbs. However, they are more likely to use their breath weapon or gaze attack before entering melee. Up to thrice a day, a dracolisk is capable of shooting an acid stream out of its mouth up to 30 ft and with a width of 5 ft; this causes 4d6 damage to anybody caught in its path, though a successful saving throw vs breath weapons reduces this by half.

The bite of a homonculus is venomous and causes a comatose state for 1d6 × 5 (5-30) minutes unless the victim saves vs magic to negate. A homonculus is a reflection of its magic user creator and therefore rolls saves at whatever level its owner makes his saving throws.

A homonculus cannot speak, but knows what its creator knows, and can communicate what it sees and hears to its creator via a limited form of telepathy up to 500 ft away. A homonculus will never willingly exceed the maximum communication range. The homonculus is completely under control of its creator, who need not concentrate on control to maintain it. This means the homonculus can be given a specific goal, which it will then plan to achieve, carrying out its orders without further attention from its creator.<br /><br />Homonculi make excellent messengers, scouts, or spies. A homonculus can either walk upright like a human or fly, as need dictates. It is very quick and agile in combat, darting in and out of melee to deliver its venomous bite. Killing a homonculus deals an immediate 2d10 points of damage to its master. If the owner of the homonculus dies, the homonculus immediately disappears in a puff of smoke. Since Homonculi are constructs and not natural creatures they are never encountered in the wild.<br /><br />Homonculi are created in a process involving both the spell-caster and the services of an alchemist. The alchemist will require 1d4 × 500 (500-2,000) gold pieces, a pint of the magic user’s blood, and 1d4 weeks to prepare the base mixture of fluids which will form the creature. Within 24 hours of the alchemist completing the mixture process the magic user must cast the following spells upon the fluid, in order: <i>mending</i>, <i>mirror image</i>, and <i>wizard eye</i>. The spells must be cast by the person who gave the blood for the basic mixture (though scrolls may be used). Failure to cast the spells within 24 hours or casting the required spells out of order ruins that mixture and the whole process and all costs must be repeated. Upon completion of the <i>wizard eye</i> spell the fluid coalesces into a ready-to-use homonculus.'

For some reason they were forced to retreat to the deepest depths of the oceans. In the darkness they grew larger and more powerful. They excavated huge labyrinths in the sea floor. Now they prey on ships for food and slaves which they drag down to their watery dungeons. A kraken will attack a ship in the same way a giant squid does, by anchoring itself with 2 arms and attacking with the other 8. If the kraken wraps 6 tentacles around a ship and squeezes for 3 consecutive rounds, it will cause enough damage to sink the ship.<br /><br />A kraken’s body is protected by a tough shell (AC 0), but its tentacles and head are more vulnerable (AC 5). Two tentacles are covered with barbs and do 2d6 damage. The other 6 tentacles hit for 2d4 damage. With each successful hit the kraken grabs its victim and holds it. With each successive round the tentacle does an additional 3d4 crushing damage. The kraken’s sharp beak bites for 5d4 damage. Once held, the only way to get free is to sever the tentacle by causing 16 hp damage to it.<br /><br />Those within the tentacle’s grasp are 25% likely to have both arms held, and as such they are helpless. Most of the time (50%) they will have one limb held and are able to attack with a -3 penalty. The other 25% of the time the victim will both arms free and can attack the squid with only a -1 penalty.<br /><br />If the kraken looses more then 3 arms it will release the ship and flee. As it does the monster will release ink in the water leaving a cloud 80 ft deep by 80 ft wide by 120 ft long. A kraken’s ink is poisonous and will cause 1d4 points of damage per round until the ink dissipates. The ink lasts for about 5 rounds.<br /><br />They also have following spell-like abilities. A kraken is able to create a sphere of <i>airy water</i> 240 ft across once per day, create <i>faerie fire</i> for 8 hours, <i>control temperature</i> (40 ft), <i>control winds</i>, and <i>weather summoning</i> once each per day.

Mermen are much like rural humans, farming and harvesting vegetation on the ocean floor and hunting in the area around their settlements; they hunt for fish and other sea-going creatures. Merfolk have been known to herd certain fish, keeping them corralled in large, spherical netted seaweed pens in much the same way their human counterparts will herd cattle.<br /><br />Merfolk tend to congregate in small communities, establishing their dwellings in reefs or underwater cliffs and tunnelling many rooms and passages into these natural structures. Rarely, mermen will construct dwellings of natural materials such as seashells, coral, rocks, and materials scavenged from sunken sailing vessels. The community will consist of roughly equal numbers of mermen, mermaids (as the female of the species is called), and younglings. These communities, no matter the location, will correspond to a human agricultural type community in many respects: there will be workshops, residences, pens for the food fish, and storage areas for the harvested sea vegetation. Merfolk communities are guarded by 3d6 giant gar (q. v.), bred and trained by the mermen for this purpose. Merfolk rarely venture from the ocean but can sometimes be spotted sunning themselves on coastal rocks in isolated areas.<br /><br />In battle, half the merman troops encountered will be armed with dagger and trident. The remainder of the forces will be evenly split between crossbow and dagger; or net, javelin, and dagger. Mermen crossbows are identical in function to the sahuagin crossbow (see monster listing: sahuagin). If the mermen encountered are seeking to capture a surface ship (see below) 25% of the trident-armed troops will also be equipped with grapples that have 50 ft of line attached.<br /><br />Though mermen tend to avoid humans under most circumstances, they have been known to attack and sink surface vessels to plunder them. Grappling hook-equipped mermen will surface and hurl their grapples up to 30 ft as the other mermen attack exposed crewman on the ship with crossbows and thrown javelins. The merfolk are quite proficient with grapples and will successfully score a hit on a roll of 1-9 on a 1d10. If a grapple hits it will be grabbed and held by 10 mermen, causing the ship to lose 30 ft per round of top speed for each successful grapple attack. If the crew of the ship manages to cut a grapple line it will take the 10 mermen holding the line a round to regroup and return to the fight. Any merman grappling the ship or laying down cover fire is exposed to ranged attack from the ship. Further, fire based attacks will cause double damage but only for a single round. If the grappled ship is successfully rendered motionless it will be pulled underwater in 4d4 rounds. Any crewmen abandoning ship at this time will be ignored as the ship and mermen sink beneath the waves. Mermen do not take surface dwellers prisoner, but will not normally harm any crewmen in the water—unless the crew of the ship foolishly try to continue the battle.<br /><br />Merfolk appear as completely normal humans from the waist up and as man-sized fish or dolphins from the waist down. They disdain clothing, though mermaids will often adorn themselves with plundered jewellery and mermen will use any enchanted weapons and protective magic rings or bracers they may gain in their raids. Mermen speak their own language, 50% speak locathah, and if the merfolk dwell near any other intelligent aquatic creatures at least 10% of the community will be able to speak that tongue as well.'

Death worms move completely silently, and are immune to sleep, charm, mind-affecting spells; they never check morale and they are immune to poison. In spite of these and other similarities to the undead, the necrophidius is not an undead creature and cannot be turned by a cleric.<br /><br />A necrophidius will surprise its prey 50% of the time. If it is not surprised it will begin its <i>Dance of Death</i>. This attack is a swaying, hypnotic dance that will dominate its victim’s attention if he or she fails a saving throw vs petrifaction. An individual so dominated will stand completely motionless and unresisting as the necrophidius advances upon him or her.<br /><br />In combat the necrophidius attacks with a bite for 1d8 hp. This bite inflicts a magical paralysis upon its victim for 1d4 turns unless the target makes his or her saving throw.<br /><br />A necrophidius is a construct and there are several ways to go about creating one. First, the basic materials must be assembled: the skull of a cold-blooded murderer who has been killed within 72 hours of the ritual and the complete skeleton of a giant snake. The process will also require 10 days plus the services and laboratory of an alchemist, who will charge his or her full monthly fee plus 500 gp per hp of the completed necrophidius. At the end of 10 days, the potential owner has 24 hours to complete the ritual by one of the methods detailed hereafter.<br /><br />First, a magical book can be used. These work the same way as a <i>manual of the golems</i> (q.v.) can be used to create a golem. Second, a high level magic user can cast the following spells in this order upon the pre-necrophidius alchemical mixture: <i>limited wish</i>, <i>geas</i>, and <i>charm person</i>. Upon completion of the <i>charm person</i> spell the death worm magically assembles from the various parts, absorbing the fluids of the mixture. Last, a cleric can cast the following divine spells upon the pre-necrophidius alchemical mixture in this precise order: <i>quest</i>, <i>neutralise poison</i>, <i>prayer</i>, <i>silence 15 ft radius</i>, and <i>snake charm</i>. As with the magic user, when the last spell is completed the necrophidius magically assembles from the various parts, absorbing the fluids of the mixture.<br /><br />Because of the artificial nature of the necrophidius, they are never encountered in a lair or as a wandering monster. Instead, they are created for a specific purpose, usually as an assassin or guard. They are perfect for this role because they never sleep, they never check morale, and they never give up.'

If caught and held, she will kiss him, in which case he must save vs poison or drown.<br /><br />A nereid will always have a diaphanous shawl that contains her soul.

Their skin is dark blue-violet, their talons and lanky hair jet, their eyes red with a baneful glow.<br /><br />Night hags are numerous in their own region of Hades, but seldom found elsewhere. If success seems likely, they will attack any good aligned creature. They come to the material plane to slay very selfishly evil people, whose souls in Hades form Soul Worms (q.v.: a valuable demonic and diabolical commodity).<br /><br />Finding such a victim, a night hag casts a sleep spell that affects humans even up to 12th level who fail a saving throw vs magic, then strangles the sleeper. If the spell fails, she returns nightly while æthereal, which state she can assume at will. By entering the victim’s dreams, the hag makes him (or her) æthereal as well. Each ride until dawn by the hag (who cannot be unseated from the unfortunate’s back) permanently drains a point of constitution. When all points are drained, the victim dies and the night hag carries the soul to Hades.<br /><br />A night hag can cast a <i>magic missile</i> spell for 2d8 damage or a <i>ray of enfeeblement</i> thrice per day each. She has the power of knowing a creature’s alignment, and can <i>polymorph</i> herself at will.<br /><br />Night hags are invulnerable to <i>charm</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>sleep</i>, and cold- or fire- based spells. To harm them, a weapon must be of iron or silver or enchanted to +3 or better.<br /><br />In extremis, a night hag can try (succeeding half the time) to <i>gate</i> in an ally, with equal chances of a barbed devil or class A demon appearing. She must then reward the devil or demon with a Soul Worm, a price the night hags will be loath to pay.<br /><br />While she has a special periapt she has forged in Hades, a night hag can astrally project her body at will. Upon losing the periapt, she can still depart the plane she is in at the time. This periapt gives the possessor +2 on all saving throws, and cures diseases the possessor contracts. With each use by a good creature, the periapt decays; after ten uses, it vanishes.'

Their capacity for such swift flight is greatly valued by those they serve, as is their ferocity in combat. Nightmares hate living creatures and, being given to viciousness, will generally attack any non-evil entity they encounter. They use their fangs to bite for 2d4 damage and strike with their hooves 1d6+4 damage, which will also set any flammable objects they strike alight. In their excitement, Nightmares are also known to produce a noxious smoke that causes anyone within ten feet to have to save vs paralysis or suffer a -2 penalty to hit and damage whilst in the vicinity.<br /><br />Nightmares have a strong sense of purpose and this can make them difficult to control; it takes an iron will or powerful magic for a rider to perpetually retain mastery.

The one difference between a goblin and nilbog, however, is a very important one. Goblins infected with nilbogism are surrounded by a weakness in the eldritch fabric that separates magic and magical energy from reality. Whereas in most cases such weaknesses result in null magic zones, when contained within the nilbog’s life essence these tears in reality have a completely different effect.<br /><br />Results of being in the presence of a nilbog are chaotic and unpredictable, but always totally contrary to what the adventurer would normally desire.<br /><br />A thief sneaking into a nilbog lair might start singing at the top of her voice, a magic user might discard a travelling spell book or favourite magic wand, or a party might feel compelled to fill an empty treasure chest in the nilbog lair with their most valuable items. Persons encountering a nilbog have no choice to avoid these reversed sensibilities; no saving throw is allowed. A <i>wish</i> spell or similarly powerful magic should provide a short-lived and limited area immunity to the effects of nilbogism.<br /><br />Nilbogism also asserts its effect in combat. Striking a nilbog or casting damaging spells at it actually adds hp to the creature equal to the amount of damage that would have been inflicted normally. The only way to damage a nilbog appears to be curative magic, such as casting a <i>cure light wounds</i> spell on it. This harms the creature rather than healing it. (Some adventurers report success with force-feeding the nilbog healing potions.)<br /><br />Because nilbogs look exactly like goblins, the only way to tell one from the other is to approach it. Of course, since approaching a nilbog subjects one to the effects of nilbogism this is a risky method, at best.<br /><br />Even more rarely, nilbogism occurs in other creatures, the most ludicrous of which is the llort—a troll-like creature that if cured of damage, begins to degenerate at 3hp per round until dead.'

Often referred to by the common folk as a firebird or bennu bird, sighting a phoenix is believed to be a good omen and a mark of divine favour. Though the phoenix is a creature of the Outer Planes, it finds great joy in scenes of tranquil beauty and is therefore most often encountered deep in sylvan woods, in the company of fey creatures and woodland animals. Though a phoenix is a formidable foe many of its body parts are prized by alchemists and wizards and as a result, a phoenix in the Prime Material Plane avoids contact with most living creatures besides the fey denizens of the deep woods. Even good aligned characters seeking its help will be viewed with a degree of mistrust, at least initially.<br /><br />In combat, the phoenix employs one of two attack routines; either two clawing attacks when airborne or one beak attack if not. What makes the phoenix even more imposing in combat, however, are its myriad spell-like abilities and special powers. Through the use of these abilities, it is difficult even to engage the creature in combat if it desires to avoid it.<br /><br />Due to its other-planar nature, the phoenix can only be hit with +3 or better weapons. The creature can constantly and automatically <i>detect charm</i>, <i>detect evil</i>, and <i>detect magic</i>; constantly radiates <i>protection from fear, 10 ft radius</i>, and has a 50% magic resistance. The phoenix can become astral or æthereal at will, and once per week can transport itself and up to 10 man-sized creatures to its home plane (it can also reach its home dimension through the use of its astral and æthereal ability). A phoenix has finely-honed senses and therefore cannot be surprised. It receives +3 to all initiative rolls. The phoenix has 120 ft range in both infravision and low-light vision. This amazing being can heal itself or another creature spontaneously, up to 100 hit points total per day. It can also <i>cure disease</i> with but a touch of its beak, limited to one cure disease per creature per day. It can also cast <i>cure light wounds</i> at will with a brush of its wingtips, though any human or humanoid can only be healed thus twice during any one day. A phoenix has the innate ability to cause a tremendous heat up to thrice per day; igniting all flammable materials, boiling liquids, and blistering exposed skin. It can also dissipate any energy based attack, ranging from spells to dragon breath, up to thrice per day and taking no damage therefrom. Its powerful voice can <i>dispel illusion</i> and <i>dispel magic</i> at a level equal to a 40th level magic user, and cast <i>exorcise</i> as a 40th level cleric.<br /><br />In addition to all the above, the phoenix can use the following spell-like abilities at will, once per round at a 20th level of ability, unless otherwise noted: <i>affect normal fires</i>, <i>audible glamour</i>, <i>blink</i>, <i>blindness</i>, <i>blur</i>, <i>control temperature 50’ radius</i>, <i>continual light</i>, <i>find traps</i>, <i>fire charm</i>, <i>fire shield</i>, <i>improved invisibility</i>, <i>misdirection</i>, <i>produce flame</i>, <i>pyrotechnics</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, <i>remove fear 10’ radius</i>, <i>snake charm</i>. Once per day, the phoenix can use the following spell-like abilities, again at 20th level: <i>call woodland beings</i>, <i>duo-dimension</i>, <i>find the path</i>, <i>fire quench</i> (reverse of the druid spell <i>produce fire</i>), <i>fire seeds</i>, <i>fire storm</i>, <i>neutralise poison</i>, <i>reincarnate</i>, <i>veil</i>, <i>wall of fire</i>. Thrice per day the phoenix can cast <i>colour spray</i>, <i>heat metal</i>, <i>polymorph self</i>, and once per week can cast <i>incendiary cloud</i>.<br /><br />The phoenix has two final special abilities it will only use when great need is upon it. First, it can fire up to 8 of its feathers at its opponents per round. These feathers will sap 5 hp apiece from the phoenix and explode as a holly berry <i>fireseed</i>. If overcome in battle, the phoenix can release its version of a retributive strike—invoking a hellish firestorm of destruction equal in power to a <i>firestorm</i> combined with an <i>incendiary cloud</i>, each cast at 40th level of ability. This mega-firestorm can be created even if both spell abilities have already been used that day. This attack will kill the phoenix (and most likely everything else within range) but leaves behind a crystalline egg the size of an adult human head. A new phoenix will arise from the egg in 3d8 days.<br /><br />The phoeni× is a large bird vaguely resembling a stork or heron, with beautiful plumage of bright gold and fiery red that catches the light in a manner reminiscent of dancing flames. Its dagger-sharp claws and long, hard beak are an iridescent violet; the eyes of a phoeni× have been described as rubies glowing with an inner fire. The phoeni× speaks the language of its kind; the language of any feathered, flying creature; and can communicate with other creatures with either telepathy or telempathy, as appropriate to the level of intelligence of the other creature.'

It is a living creature encased in a stone covering. Piercers are sensitive to noise and heat and when they detect a source of either passing beneath them they drop, seeking to kill and devour their target.<br /><br />A piercer has a single attack, seeking to impale the unlucky victim with its sharp point. After killing and feasting the piercer will move via tiny cilia in its base back up to the ceiling. Any grouping of piercers will include a mix of the various HD, roll 1d4 with 1 = 1 HD, 2 = 2 HD, 3 = 3 HD, and 4 = 4 HD. A piercer will do 1d6 of damage for each of its HD.<br /><br />The 1 HD piercer is 3 ft long and weighs about 200 lbs. With each additional HD the piercer adds another foot of length and another 100 lbs of weight. Piercers devour even the bones of their victims and any intelligent cave or dungeon dwelling denizens living nearby will often (carefully) scavenge any armour, weapons, money, magic, or anything else remaining of even the least value.'

Because of the lack of a breath weapon, they are not generally counted among the true dragons. Pseudo-dragons can be be found in almost every climate save the very hottest and coldest, and prefer snug lairs such as small caves or hollow trees.<br /><br />In combat the pseudo-dragon will attack with a bite attack for 1d3 points of damage, but its feared weapon is its sting. The pseudo-dragon’s small size and great flying speed, coupled with the flexibility of its tail, grant a +4 bonus to stinging attacks. Any creature stung is allowed a save vs poison to negate the effects, otherwise the victim will fall into a death-like trance for 1d6 days. On the last day of the trance there is a 25% chance the victim will actually die.<br /><br />Pseudo-dragons have a chameleon ability and are able to change their normal dark red colouration to match their surroundings and becoming 80% undetectable to creatures not able to see invisible. Pseudo-dragons can themselves see invisible objects.<br /><br />These creatures also have an innate magic resistance and are able to grant this resistance to its human or demihuman companions by touch. Pseudo-dragons are also able to communicate everything they see and hear to its companion via a limited form of telepathy at distances of up to 240 ft. These abilities make the pseudo-dragon a highly-prized familiar or pet.'

They live deep underground where they are constantly on the search for food. They are attracted to vibrations up to 60 ft away. These creatures always return to their lair to rest. During this time they will pass their waste consisting of metals and gems they could not digest.<br /><br />A purple worm’s main attack is its bite that does 2d12 points of damage. If the purple worm scores a natural 20 then it has engulfed its prey whole. If the victim is not rescued, they will die within 6 rounds. It is also possible for the victim to cut their way out. The inside of a purple worm is armour class 10. For each round that the victim is inside subtract 1 from their damage that they inflict. This penalty is cumulative for each round, so after four rounds the damage inflicted is at -4. As well as its bite a purple worm also has a poisonous stinger on their tail. Any creature stung takes 2d4 damage and must save vs poison or die.'
