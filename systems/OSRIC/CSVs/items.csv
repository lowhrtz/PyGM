These abilities do not require the expenditure of charges.<br /><br />In addition, the staff has the following abilities that cost 1 charge per use: <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>fireball</i>, <i>ice storm</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, <i>knock</i>, <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>passwall</i>, <i>pyrotechnics</i>, <i>wall of fire</i>, and <i>web</i>. The following powerful abilities cost 2 charges per use: <i>conjure elemental</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, <i>telekinesis</i>, and <i>whirlwind</i> (as a genie).<br /><br />The wielder of the staff receives a bonus of +2 for saving throws vs magic. This staff may be recharged, but only by absorbing magical energies that are cast at the wielder. When a spell is cast at the wielder, he may choose to absorb these energies, at a rate of 1 charge per spell level of the spell directed at him. Note that taking this manoeuvre is the sole action of the staff for that round, and it may not be used for other effects in the same round it absorbs energy. Each staff has a maximum number of possible charges, and it will only safely absorb charges to this limit. The wielder will not know the limit, or how many charges have been used, unless some magical means is employed to discover this. The staff does not reveal this information. Should the staff collect energy in excess of its limit, it detonates in the same manner as in a retributive strike, as described below.<br /><br />A <i>staff of wizardry</i> can be used for a <i>retributive strike</i>, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. The breaking of the staff must be intentional and declared by the wielder. All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30 ft radius. All within 10 ft of the broken staff take points of damage equal to 8 × the number of charges in the staff, those 10 ft to 20 ft away take 6 × the number of charges in damage, and those 20 ft to 30 ft distant take 4 × the number of charges in damage. All those affected can make saving throws vs magic to reduce the damage by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of travelling to another plane of existence, but if he or she does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him or her. Only the <i>staff of wizardry</i> and the <i>staff of power</i> may be used for a <i>retributive strike</i>.<br /><br />After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +2 quarterstaff.

'ring_spell_storing','Ring of Spell Storing','Ring',,'0','Not sold','25000',,,,,'yes',,,,,,,,'<b>(any)</b><br />A ring that can magically store 2-5 spells and grants the wearer the ability to cast them as if he or she were a spell caster of the required type. Casting a spell from the ring requires 5 segments. Roll d%, a roll of 01-70 means the ring stores magic user spells and 71-00 indicates clerical spells. 10% of magic user <i>rings of spell storing</i> will contain illusionist spells instead, and 25% of clerical <i>rings of spell storing</i> will contain druid spells instead. Roll 2d4 to determine number of spells the ring can contain. To randomly determine the spell levels of each spell, roll 1d6 (on a result of 6 reroll for level with 1d4) for cleric, druid or illusionist spells, and 1d8 (on a result of 8 reroll for level with 1d6) for magic user spells. Once type, number, and level of spells is determined, the GM must decide which spells the ring contains. The spells can either be hand-picked or the GM may use the OSRIC magic tables and dice for spells randomly. Once the class of spells, their number and level, and the exact spells to be stored are determined, that capability can never be changed. Charging the ring requires a spell caster to cast the specific spell to be stored with the ring as the target of the spell.<br /><br /><i><b>Example of Ring of Spell Storing Creation:</b></i> Jerry the GM decides to place a <i>ring of spell storing</i> in a red dragon’s treasure hoard. He rolls a 57 on d%, indicating the ring contains magic user spells. A second d% roll yields a 05 and this means the ring really contains spells of the illusionist class. Jerry now rolls 2d4 and gets 1 on both dice, meaning the ring will contain 2 spells total. Jerry now rolls 1d6 twice, one for each spell to determine the level of that spell. The first result is a 2, the second is a 6. The 6 needs to be rerolled on a 1d4 and rolling that die generates a result of 4. So, the GM now knows the ring will hold 2 illusionist spells, one of level 2 and one of level 4. Jerry decides to let fate take a hand in the selection of the exact spells the ring stores and takes a look at the illusionist spell tables in the OSRIC manual. There are 12 level 2 illusionist spells, and 8 level 4 spells, so Jerry grabs a d12 and a d8 and rolls them both. The d12 rolls a 4 so Jerry notes the result of <i>detect magic</i>. The d8 rolls an 8 and Jerry notes the result of <i>shadow monsters</i>. Now that the exact properties of the <i>ring of spell storing</i> have been determined, they can never be changed; the ring will ever after only hold the two illusionist spells noted. If the finder of the ring uses it to cast a <i>detect magic</i> spell, then an illusionist must cast a <i>detect magic</i> upon the ring to recharge that spell slot.'
'ring_spell_turning','Ring of Spell Turning','Ring',,'0','Not sold','17500',,,,,'yes',,,,,,,,'<style type=text/css>table {border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;} td, th{padding: 3px}</style><b>(any)</b><br />This magic ring creates a powerful magic aura around the wearer that will partially reflect any spells cast at him or her back onto the spell caster. There are three exceptions to the spell turning ability the ring bestows:<ul><li>Area effect spells which are not directly targeted upon the ring bearer cannot be turned.</li><li>Touch-based spells cannot be turned.</li><li>Spell effects delivered by devices are not turned. Examples include: rods, staves, wands, rings. Note: spell scrolls are not considered devices.</li></ul><br />When a spell is cast at the wearer of the <i>ring of spell turning</i>, he or she rolls a d10 and multiplies the result by 10. When damage from the spell attack is determined, the number generated by this roll indicates what percentage of the damage is reflected back upon the attacker. Thus if “6” appears on the d10, 60% of the damage rolled would be deducted from the attacking spell-caster’s hit points and 40% from the target. Further, for each 10% of difference between the damage percentage rolled and 100%, the ring-bearer gains +1 to his or her saving throw. Going back to the example above, the spell’s target would get a +6 to his or her saving throw and the spell caster would gain a +4.<br /><br />The <i>ring of spell turning</i> also grants a saving throw against spells which normally do not allow one. In such a case, the save will be half of the percentage die roll for spell reflection. Returning once again to the example above, the ring wearer rolling a 60% chance of reflecting an attacking spell would gain a 30% saving throw, reducing or negating effects as appropriate to the spell.<br /><br />Spells that only affect a certain number of levels must be able to affect the target’s and caster’s levels combined, otherwise the spell has no effect on either party. If the ring’s wearer wishes to receive the effects of a targeted spell, he or she must first remove the ring. (Healing spells are exempt, since they are touch-based.) If both caster and target are wearing <i>rings of spell turning</i>, roll d% and consult the table below.<table><tr><th>d%</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td>01-70</td><td>Spell fails completely, no effect on target or caster</td></tr><tr><td>71-80</td><td>Spell takes full effect on both target and caster</td></tr><tr><td>81-97</td><td>Spell fails and both rings are destroyed</td></tr><tr><td>98-00</td><td>A rift into the Positive Material Plane opens, both target and caster are sucked in</td></tr></table>'

Any time a gate is opened to any plane besides the Prime Material, there is a non-cumulative 10% chance per round a denizen of that plane sees the gate and comes through to investigate, and depending upon the plane contacted, such creatures will rarely have a favourable reaction to the PCs. Pressing a cube side twice in rapid succession will instantly transport the user and all creatures adjacent to him to a random point on the plane to which that side is keyed. Unwilling beings gain a saving throw vs petrifaction to avoid this plane-shift.'
'dark_skull','Dark Skull','Misc Magic',,'0','Not sold','60000',,,,,'yes',,,,,,,,'<b>(C)</b><br />This likeness of a human skull is artfully and cunningly carved from a block of darkest ebony, and it is unrelentingly and entirely evil. The presence of the Dark Skull makes any site, building, or structure an unholy site and gains 3 major effects in a 40 ft radius around the skull.<br /><br />First, the structure or site is guarded by a magic circle of protection from good (as the 1st level cleric spell). Next, all turning attempts by good aligned or neutral characters within the structure or site are made at -4, while evil characters gain a +4 bonus to their own turning attempts. Magic resistance does not apply to this effect. Third, the user of the skull may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site. Regardless of the normal parameters for the spell, this usage will last for 1 full year and will be effective throughout the entire site or structure.<br /><br />The user can further designate whether the spell effects will apply to all creatures or creatures of a particular faith or alignment. Though the spell effects lapse after 1 year, they are quickly and easily renewed using the Dark Skull, often as part of an unholy annual ritual. Commonly favoured spells for binding include: <i>cause blindness</i>, <i>chant</i>, <i>curse</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>know alignment</i>, and <i>true seeing</i>; though the choice is up to the user. Saving throws and magic resistance apply normally for these fixed spells.<br /><br />The skull will negate but not dispel a hallowed site with its presence; removing the Dark Skull will restore a holy place to its rightful status. Only one Dark Skull may operate in an area at any given time.'

Close inspection, however, will reveal a vague resemblance to a horse. Upon command this statuette becomes a heavy warhorse with the following special abilities, usable at will once each per round: first, the steed can fly up to 40 ft per round, 30 ft if rider is wearing heavy armour. Second, the <i>obsidian steed</i> can <i>plane shift</i>. Third, the mount and its rider (and equipment) can become æthereal. This statuette can be used once per week for up to 24 hours. Market value is 28,500 gp.</li><li><b>Onyx Dog:</b> This statuette becomes a large dog similar to a war dog but with an intelligence of 8, the ability to track as a 10th level ranger, 60 ft infravision, and can <i>see invisible</i>. The onyx dog is large and strong enough to bear a small creature as a rider. Market value is 15,500 gp.</li><li><b>Serpentine Owl:</b> With the proper command word, this statuette becomes either a horned owl or a giant owl. This transformation can take place once per day for up to 8 hours.

Market value is 9,100 gp.</li><li><b>Silver Raven:</b> Upon command this figurine becomes a raven but retains it silvery metallic surface, giving it an AC 0. The raven can be used as a magical messenger, capable of carrying a message or small token to a designated spot and awaiting the designated recipient of the message.

'iron_flask','Iron Flask','Misc Magic',,'0','Not sold','170000',,,,,'yes',,,,,,,,'<b>(CDM)</b><br />This cold iron container is inscribed around with runes of great power and is sealed with a brass stopper inlaid with arcane symbols and ancient sigils. The owner of the flask can command any extra-planar creature short of demigod power within 60 ft into the flask by speaking the command word. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. The various magic symbols on the flask negate any magic resistance the creature may have, but there is a slight chance (1 in 20) the creature can evade entrapment. Loosing the stopper on the flask frees the creature inside. If the command word is not spoken when the stopper is removed, the creature will react to being freed according to its natural inclination, probably attacking the user. If the command word is spoken when the stopper is removed the creature is bound into the remover’s service for the period of 1 hour, after which it is banished back to its home plane for the period of a year and a day. It is unwise to attempt to recapture the creature at the end of its service; the creature gains a cumulative +2 to its saving throw and will be implacably hostile to the user. This means at the end of its year and a day banishment it will return to deal with its tormentor in any way it sees fit.<br /><br />A newly-discovered bottle may already have a being impri­soned.'

This function can be used once per day for up to 30 minutes. In addition to defence, once per week the lyre can also be used for construction. Once per week the music of the <i>lyre of building</i> can magically build walls, tunnels, mines, ditches, even complete buildings. Playing 30 minutes of magical music from the lyre is equal to 100 human beings working for 3 days. After an hour of playing in this manner 1d20 is rolled and the player must roll 18-20 to continue playing, with an additional check every hour.'
